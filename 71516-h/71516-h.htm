<p>The night was of velvety blacknessâ€”one of those soft, warm, dark
nights of June when the southwest wind rolls a cloud-curtain over the
stars, when the air is heavy with unshed rain, when lamps burn dully,
and when a nameless oppression broods over the face of the land.</p>

<p>Seated at an open casement looking out into the London night was a
woman. Her hands grasped each other over her knee with a tense grip
which gave the lie to the calm of her face. Hers was a face to which in
repose Rossetti would have woven an adoring sonnet, though not as to
another "lazy, laughing, languid Jenny, fond of a kiss, and fond of a
guinea," but a sonnet of purity and peace. Yet if the sonnet had been
written, and the woman had read, the full scarlet lips which seemed to
have gathered into them all the colour from her face, would have parted
in scornful laughter.</p>

<p>Her eyes, a part of the night into which they gazed, had dull
shadows beneath them, painted there by weariness, yet she still sat
motionless in a strained attitude of expectation.</p>

<p>Her sole companion, seated a few yards away in an
easy chair, looked up at her occasionally from a book
which he held in his hand and smiled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>Lynton Hora, the Commandatore, as he chose to be called by the
members of his household, was in quite another way an equally
interesting type of humanity. He was a man of seventy inches, broad
shouldered and lean flanked, with well-poised head. His hair was grey
at the sides, his face was clean-shaven. Seen lounging in the easy
chair, with his face in the shadow, he appeared to be a man of not more
than fortyâ€”an old-young student, perhaps, for there were thought lines
on his brow and his cheeks were almost as pallid as those of the woman
at the window. Such an impression would, however, have been speedily
put to flight, immediately he looked up. Then there could be no
mistaking the man of action. The keen, hard, grey eyes, the domineering
nose, the firmly cut lips, labelled him definitelyâ€”conclusively.</p>

<p>Presently the woman altered her position. The in-drawing of her
breath, as she turned from the window, might have been a sigh. She
looked around at her companion.</p>

<p>He seemed conscious of the movement, as, without
lifting his eyes, he asked lazily: "Tired, Myra?"</p>

<p>She strove to reproduce the quietude of his tone as she replied: "A
little. What's the time now, Commandatore?" but there was a tremor in
her voice, which showed clearly that she was not so indifferent as she
wished to appear.</p>

<p>The man tossed down his book.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said.</p>

<p>Almost as if in answer to his summons the voice of
Big Ben floated softly in through the windowâ€”oneâ€”two.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>"He ought to be back by now," she said, and rising,
she began to rearrange the roses in a bowl on a table
near.</p>

<p>"I don't expect Guy for another hour at least," said
the man carelessly, though he watched the woman keenly
as he spoke. "After thatâ€”well, if we don't see him in
an hour, we shall probably not see him for five years, at
least."</p>

<p>The woman winced as from a blow.</p>

<p>"Five, or seven? It won't matter much, will it?" she replied
quietly. Then in a moment her self-control dropped from her. Her
lethargy vanished. A light came into her eyes, her nostrils became
vibrant. Without alteration of pitch her voice became passionate. "It
is horribleâ€”brutal of youâ€”to send him on such a business. What can
possess you to do such a thingâ€”can you not spare evenâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"Hush!" The man's voice interrupted her. He spoke with silken
suavity. "How often have I told you that the reiteration of facts
known to both parties to a conversation is the hall-mark of the
unintelligent!" "By Jove, Myra," he continued, changing the subject,
"how really beautiful you are! What a lucky dog Guy is to rouse such an
interest!"</p>

<p>The woman dropped her eyes and the man continued meditatively, "What
a vast alteration has taken place in the ideal of feminine beauty
since the fifteenth century! Do you know, Myra, while you have been
sitting so patiently at the window I have been measuring you by the
canons of beauty laid down by that sleek old churchman, Master Agnolo
Firenzuola"â€”he tapped the black letter volume which lay beside himâ€”"and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
though he, I'm afraid, would have many faults to find with your
featuresâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>The levity of his tone roused her again to passionate
utterance.</p>

<p>"No more," she cried. "Have you no heart left in
you, Commandatore, that you can send your own son to
such danger and sit there calmly reading whileâ€”â€”"
She broke off abruptly, her voice choked with a sob.</p>

<p>Lynton Hora rose from his seat and viewed the
woman, who shrank from his steady gaze.</p>

<p>"Have matters gone so far as that?" he asked, and
his lips smiled cynically.</p>

<p>She made no reply.</p>

<p>"You never asked my permission," he continued dispassionately. "Guy
has said nothing. I am afraid, Myra, I shall have to see that he is
protected from your influence."</p>

<p>She looked at him appealingly, and her eyes were as
the night, heavy with unshed rain.</p>

<p>"Heâ€”isâ€”yourâ€”son," she said slowly. "Iâ€”I cannot
do him the harm that you can do him, and yetâ€”I am
afraid for him. Perhaps you had better send me away,
Commandatore. My fears may make a coward of him."</p>

<p>The man spoke as if musing aloud. "Where shall I
send you? Back to the gutter from whence I picked you?
Do you remember anything of your home, Myra?"</p>

<p>"I know. I know," she protested. "You have reminded
me often enough."</p>

<p>He paid no heed to her appeal.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," he said, "I visited the place. No, it has
not tumbled down yet, my dearâ€”the very house where
your mother sold you to me for half-a-crown and a bottle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
of gin, a dirty child of five. That was fifteen years agoâ€”fifteen years
ago to-day. You were unwanted, uncared forâ€”I wanted you, I cared for
you. Let me tell you how I found your mother, Myra?"</p>

<p>She lifted her hands with a gesture of appeal, but he
disregarded the action.</p>

<p>"She occupies the same old room. There's but little light finds its
way through the dirty window, though enough to show that your mother
has not changed her habitsâ€”nor her rags. She sat there alone, like a
dropsical spider and cried aloud for gin. Would you like to change
this"â€”his hand directed attention to the apartmentâ€”"for a share of your
mother's abode, Myra Norton?"</p>

<p>Myra had seated herself. She made no answer for a while. Her eyes
wandered about the long apartment, with its shaded lights and its
flowers and its luxurious furniture. Her hand dropped on the silken
gauze of her dress. The man watching smiled as he saw the flash of
the diamonds on her fingers and noted the caressing motion of her
fingers upon the shimmering fabric. At last she raised her eyes to her
questioner.</p>

<p>"You could not send me back," she said.</p>

<p>"I could send you to a worse place," he replied coldly.
"You know my power."</p>

<p>She shuddered.</p>

<p>His tone changed completely.</p>

<p>"You little fool," he said roughly, but with a kindliness his speech
had lacked hitherto. "You know very well that I could never let you go
back to the stews from which I rescued you. But I wanted to remind you,
Myra, that you belong to meâ€”that, like myself, you are pledged to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
warâ€”a merciless, devouring, devastating war with Society; that you,
even as I myself, are outcastâ€”one from whom the world would shrinkâ€”you
have been in danger of forgetting lately, Myra."</p>

<p>"I have not forgotten," she answered with comparative
quietness, "but I have been thinking of what is the use
of it all, this eternal warfare against the world. You
have won again and again. You have told me that you
are the richer by what the world has lost. You lack
nothing that money may buy. There must come a time
when the warrior must rest."</p>

<p>"Not while his arm retains its strength to lift his
sword," replied Hora, "and by that time he should have
provided someone to take his place."</p>

<p>"But if that person is unequal to the task?" Myra
queried timidly.</p>

<p>"He pays the penalty," answered Hora.</p>

<p>"Even if it is your own son?" she persisted.</p>

<p>"Or your lover," he added coldly.</p>

<p>"Your heart is iron," she murmured despairingly.</p>

<p>He laughed aloud. "Or non-existent," he said. "It
was stolen from me years ago, and I have forgotten what
it was like to be possessed of one. Now I have only
my professionâ€”and in that I am first. You admit that,
Myra?"</p>

<p>"I admit that," she replied sullenly.</p>

<p>"Why should I not train my successor to take my place
when my day comes?"</p>

<p>The woman in the listener cried out instinctively "Because
he has what you lackâ€”a heart."</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. "It is easily lost, Myra. What
if I should say to you some day: Take it from him,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
toss it away, trample on it, break it, or store it away and
treasure it with your trinketsâ€”do as you like with it?"</p>

<p>"You wouldâ€”â€”" She rose from her seat and faced
him with extended arms. Her lips were slightly parted.
The shadows had flitted away from her eyes. Her bosom
rose stormily from its gauze veilings. Her lithe form
was poised expectantly.</p>

<p>"By Jove, you are beautiful, Myra," he answered.</p>

<p>"I am glad of itâ€”glad," she cried exultantly.</p>

<p>Hora stood in a thoughtful attitude.</p>

<p>"Myraâ€”Myrrha," he half-mused, turning the name
about, "a good name for a love-potion, there's a foreshadowing
of the bitterness of love in it."</p>

<p>Her brow clouded and she turned away. "You are
always mocking me," she muttered.</p>

<p>"No," he said, and he stepped across the room to her
side. There was something strange about his walk. He
passed across the room with the swift, stealthy swing of
a pantherâ€”a wounded panther, for one foot dragged after
the other and robbed his progress of complete grace.
He came to her side and laid his hand on her arm.</p>

<p>"I am not mocking, Myra," he said seriously. "I
have long wanted to know exactly where Guy was placed
in your thoughts. You have never revealed yourself
until to-night. Even now I am not quite sureâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Myra's countenance cleared and a happy smile shone
on her face. She looked up at him expectantly.</p>

<p>"You can tell me how much you care for him," he
continued. "I shall not reveal your confidence to Guy."</p>

<p>She dropped her eyes.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell anyone," she whispered with a strange
shyness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>Hora smiled whimsically. "What liars love makes of
us all," he said. "Yet perhaps you are speaking truthfully.
You cannot tell me what you do not know."</p>

<p>"I could dieâ€”die happilyâ€”for him," she murmured
softly.</p>

<p>"Fools sometimes die for utter strangers," remarked
Hora sardonically. "That's not love. Could you live
for him, could you give yourself to another for his welfare,
could youâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"Not that, no, not that!" The cry was wrung from
her lips. "You would not condemn me to that, Commandatore?"</p>

<p>"Hush, Myra," he said. "I was merely speaking of
possibilities which might arise in the future."</p>

<p>"I thought," she faltered, "that some scheme had
crossed your brain, which would necessitateâ€”I could not
do it now."</p>

<p>"I have thought of no scheme," he replied reassuringly,
"which would wither this new flower which has blossomed
in your heart."</p>

<p>"You are mocking again," she remarked.</p>

<p>"I am speaking seriously," he retorted, "of possibilities which
might occur. Guy's mate must be prepared for anythingâ€”for everything.
You must remember that I am not to be turned aside from the object
I have in view. Nor is Guy to be turned aside either. His will is
as inflexible as mine. The woman who mates with him must be at one
with him in his purpose, and, if need be, must be ready to sacrifice
herself. Tell me now, Myra, if you can do that, or must I find a mate
for him who will?"</p>

<p>She did not hesitate a moment. The blood rushed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
her face. "For Guy I would do anything," she cried.
"All that I ask is to be near him to help him toâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"To weaken him with your woman fears," Hora interpolated.</p>

<p>"No," she cried. "He would never know that I
feared for his safety. Let me try, Commandatore. Give
a fair chanceâ€”only that!"</p>

<p>He meditated a while, then he tapped Myra's arm with
his finger.</p>

<p>"You shall have your chance," he said. "But remember
it is your business to keep him to his profession. He
has no time for lovemaking. You shall have your chance,
but be sure you use it wisely. If you do, the day may
come when I shall say to Guy, there is your wifeâ€”and the
wife will be the child I have picked from the gutter and
educated and treated as my own."</p>

<p>There was a brooding menace in the tone in which he
finished, and the woman feared to waken him to speech
again. At last, he said harshly:</p>

<p>"Have you no thanks, Myra?"</p>

<p>"You frighten me sometimes, Commandatore," she
answered timidly. "I cannot understand you."</p>

<p>"You will do so some day," he replied. He seemed amused at the idea,
for he laughed and spoke good-humouredly. "If you make good use of your
chances, my girl, everything will become clear to you. You have wit
as well as beauty, Myra. Make use of them both. He is of an age to be
caught."</p>

<p>Through the open window the voice of Big Ben solemnly
tolled three.</p>

<p>The light died out of the woman's face. "Cruel," she
murmured in a tense, hoarse whisper. "It was cruel to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
mock me so. Something has happened to him. The
hour has passed. Oh! Guy, Guy!"</p>

<p>Lynton Hora turned upon her fiercely. "Is this a specimen of your
self-control?" he said. "Haven't you learned that in the profession
Guy has adopted a thousand trivial events may supply reason for delay?
Mind, if I have any snivelling I withdraw my promise."</p>

<p>Myra was constrained into silence. She went to the window. Already
the black night had given place to the grey mists of coming dawn. She
looked out over the park. Uprising from the sea of shadows objects
began to emerge. From the near distance the music of violins and harps
throbbed to a waltz measure. She stood there unheeding while the light
strengthened, and the dawn came up from the east in a glory of crimson
and gold. She stood there unseeing, her heart throbbing with agony, yet
with face schooled to complete apathy.</p>

<p>The rose and the gold faded from the sky. Another day had begun. She
had forgotten Hora's presence, forgotten everything. She closed the
window and lifted her hand to pull down the blinds and shut out the
day. Hora's voice awakened her.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said, and, rising swiftly from his chair,
he pushed Myra aside and threw open the casement again.
The sharp sound of the bell of an electric brougham
entered that window on the eighth storey just as the
voice of Big Ben proclaimed four.</p>

<p>"Only somebody's brougham," said Myra listlessly.</p>

<p>"My brougham," replied Hora curtly. "Bringing
Guy home."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders. "Coming back without
him, most likely," she said. Still, in spite of the remark,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
hope showed itself in her expression. The carriage
stopped. For five minutes a strained silence endured.
It was broken by the sound of an outside door opening
and shutting. Another pause! Both were looking
towards the door of the apartment in which Myra and
Hora stood expectantly. Hora held up his finger warningly
to his companion.</p>

<p>The door opened and there entered a young man in
evening clothes, his coat was over his arm, upon which
an umbrella was hooked, and his hat was in his hand.</p>

<p>"Hullo! I didn't expect anyone to be waiting up for me," he remarked
cheerfully. "I thought that was a privilege reserved for the reprobate
sons of evangelical households. I suppose you haven't been praying for
the success of my undertaking."</p>

<p>He laughed joyously. His high spirits seemed infectious. Hora smiled
responsively. Joy illuminated Myra's expressive features like sunlight
on the woodlands after an April shower.</p>

<p>"You surely did not think that I should fail?" he
asked, looking from one to another.</p>

<p>"I did not," replied Hora drily. "Myra scarcely
shared my confidence though. She seemed to think that
it was brutal of me to give you a chance of showing what
you could do, when working on your own account."</p>

<p>The young man laughed again.</p>

<p>"These womenâ€”these women," he said. Then he turned to Myra. "I
thought that you, at least, would have had confidence in me." He tossed
his coat on to a chair, and going to her, encircled her waist with his
arm. "Did you really think I should fail in my first coup?" he asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>"Noâ€”noâ€”no," she cried vehemently. "But, oh,
Guy! I was afraid. If I could only have come with youâ€”to
have shared in the danger."</p>

<p>"Then I probably should have failed," he added. "As
it isâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>He turned to Hora and there was a proud gleam in his
eyes. "You must set me a more difficult task next time,
Commandatore," he said.</p>

<p>"Then you have secured the picture?" asked the elder
man eagerly.</p>

<p>For reply, Guy lifted the umbrella from the table where he had laid
it down. To all appearance it was merely a specimen of the article it
pretended to be, but in the young man's hands the handle unscrewed,
revealing the fact that it was a sham. Instead of an umbrella, a long
narrow case was revealed, and from within it Guy coaxed with infinite
care a roll of canvas.</p>

<p>"It was rather a tight fit," he remarked, "but I don't
think I have damaged the picture." He unrolled the
canvas carefully on the table.</p>

<p>Hora's eyes sparkled as he looked down upon the
painting.</p>

<p>"How I have longed for a genuine Greuze to add to
my collection," he remarked, "and thisâ€”this is the most
perfect specimen in the world. My dear Guy, how can
I ever be grateful enough to you?"</p>

<p>Was there a dash of sarcasm in his voice? If so, the
young man did not notice it. He was moved to genuine
emotion.</p>

<p>"It is a little thing in return for all you have done for
me," he replied earnestly. He laid his hand on the elder
man's arm as he continued, "There's nothing I would not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
do which would add to your happinessâ€”you have given
me so much."</p>

<p>Hora shook off the grasp.</p>

<p>"The air is overcharged with sentiment," he said
lightly. "Myra here might have been trained in an English
boarding school for young ladies, she is so full of it.
And now you." He held up his hands in derision.</p>

<p>Guy laughed gaily. He was used to Hora's moods.</p>

<p>"Sentiment does sound a little incongruous from the
lips of a successful burglar, doesn't it?" he said, and he
laughed again at the whimsicality of the idea. "Yet you
know that at heart, Commandatore, you are just as much
of a sentimentalist as either Myra or myself. What else
can be the motive of your perpetual enmity with the
world?"</p>

<p>"What else; ay, what else," murmured Hora musingly,
a bitter smile about his lips. "But, all the same, there's
no need to debauch our minds with contemplation of sentiment.
It's dangerous."</p>

<p>He returned to an examination of the picture.</p>

<p>"The fool who owned this," he said, "would have
sold it. He's no poorer for the loss. It is not the loss
of the work of art that he will regret, but the loss of the
ten thousand guineas he gave for it."</p>

<p>"It is in really appreciative hands now," remarked Guy after a
pause. "By the way," he added, picking up his overcoat from the chair,
"I could not resist the temptation of bringing away a few of the best
examples of Flurscheim's snuff-boxes. I know you have a vacant corner
or two in the cabinets upstairs, and if you think they are not worthy
of being placed in them, well the brilliants in the settings will
make a necklace for Myra."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>He thrust his hand into the pockets and took out
a number of superb specimens of the art of a bygone
age.</p>

<p>"It was very thoughtful of you," said Hora, as he lifted each box
lovingly as Guy laid it on the table. There were twelve in all, and
eight he placed on one side. "These are really artistic productions,"
he said, "and I shall keep them. The others are worth no more than
the intrinsic value of the stones and of the gold of which they are
made."</p>

<p>Guy turned to Myra. "What will you have them
made into, Myra, a necklet or a bracelet?â€”I must give
you a keepsake to wear in memory of my first big
exploit."</p>

<p>"Anything you like, Guy," she answered softly, while
her face flushed with delight.</p>

<p>"Then we will think of something," he observed carelessly. He picked
up one of the boxes which Hora had placed aside. "I think I should like
to keep this one myself, Commandatore," he remarked, "as a souvenir of
the occasion."</p>

<p>Hora took it from his hand and looked at the box
curiously. In the lid was set an exquisite miniature on
ivory of a young girl, with regular, delicate features and
a cloud of golden hair.</p>

<p>"You have good taste, keep it, by all means," urged Hora carelessly.
A slight hesitation in Guy's tone as he proffered the request was
evidence to his swift brain that the young man had not revealed the
whole of his reason for the desire to retain that particular box. He
knew that he could when he liked elicit that reason. But the morning
was advancing. He began to feel wearied. He would have plenty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
of time on the morrow to learn all that he desired to know.</p>

<p>"Come, my children," he said, "it is time we went to
bed. Guy, you will help me put these new possessions
of ours into a place of security. Sleep well, Myra."</p>

<p>The woman accepted the dismissal submissively. She
re-echoed the wish, and, with a last glance over her
shoulder at Guy as she swept out of the room, she left
them.</p>

<p>"Myra's getting very fond of you, Guy," remarked
Hora when the door had closed behind her.</p>

<p>"Indeed," he answered carelessly, for his mind was
running on other matters.</p>

<p>Hora laughed at the tone, but he did not renew the
subject.</p>

<p>"What made you so late?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Some jolly people I met at the ball," he answered
absently. "I stopped an hour longer than I intended."</p>

<p>"Hâ€”m, business before pleasure is as good a motto
for your profession as for any other," said Hora.</p>

<p>"I know," answered Guy, "but stillâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"You are young," commented Hora, "I hope that in
your haste you left no clue."</p>

<p>The young man laughed. "Plenty," he said, "but all
false ones."</p>

<p>"Well, you shall tell me all about it in the morning,"
said Hora. "Bring the stuff along."</p>

<p>Guy gathered up the sham umbrella and the jewelled
snuff-boxes, slipping the one he had decided to retain for
himself into his pocket.</p>

<p>Hora raised the picture reverently and led the way out
of the room, Guy following him.

<small>CONCERNING THE GREUZE, SOME GENTILES, AND A JEW</small>
</h2>
</div>

<p>Later on that same morning all London was thrilled
by the story of a sensational burglary at the house of
Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim, the noted connoisseur and
dealer in objects of art.</p>

<p>Just at daybreak Mr. Flurscheim had been aroused by
the ringing of the burglar alarm, and, throwing on his
dressing-gown, he had rushed downstairs. There he had
found the front door open, and, running into the street,
he commenced to blow frantically the police whistle which
he had in his handâ€”he always slept with a police whistle
attached to a ribbon round his neck and with a revolver
under his pillow.</p>

<p>He had not been compelled to waste much breath before
the summons was responded to, for a constable was
almost instantly on the spot.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim dwelt in a quarter of London greatly
favoured by rank, fashion, and the children of Abraham. His house was
at the corner of a street turning into Park Lane, and at the shrill
sound of the whistle there emerged from turning after turning helmeted
men in blue who with one accord made their way at paces varying with
each man's temperament to the place where the excited art dealer stood
beckoning vigorously.</p>

<p>Mr. Flurscheim had speedily revealed his reason for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
giving the alarm. The house was surrounded by constables, and two
of the force accompanied the owner back into his house, which they
proceeded to search systematically. At this time, Mr. Flurscheim had
not discovered his loss and was disposed to think that the electric
alarm had frustrated an attempt of someone to enter his abode. But when
he arrived, in the course of the search, at his drawing-room on the
first floor, he learned that the thief had been only too successful in
the object which had brought him thither. From the place on the wall
where the gem of his collection, the Greuze, which he had sworn should
never leave his possession until Â£20,000 should have been paid into his
banking account, had hung, only an empty frame confronted him, while
tossed carelessly aside on the table was an ordinary table knife which
had been used for the purpose of cutting the canvas from the frame.</p>

<p>Upon the discovery of his loss, Mr. Flurscheim had for a while
been bereft of speech and movement. When volition returned to him, he
behaved as one demented. He wrung his hands, he tore his hair and his
clothes, and he called upon the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob to
visit his despoiler with condign punishment.</p>

<p>When a little later he discovered that some more of his choicest
treasures, the jewelled snuff-boxes of which he had the finest
collection in the world, had been carried away, he became absolutely
frantic with grief, so that even the policemen felt moved in their
hearts to pity him.</p>

<p>The frenzy did not endure long. A thing trifling in
itself was sufficient to restore the dealer to full possession
of his senses. The sergeant of police who had accompanied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
him into the room had pulled out his note book
in readiness to make notes of the occurrence, when a
clock on the mantel-shelf struck four. At the sound,
Flurscheim became still.</p>

<p>"Four o'clock," he murmured. "Four o'clock.
There's no time to lose. We must be doing." He
turned to the policeman. "Sergeant," he said dejectedly,
"I shall trust you to forget the exhibition I have made
of myselfâ€”Iâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>The sergeant answered briskly. "Very natural, I'm sure, sir.
Should have felt just like it myself, though I must admit I've put
the bracelets on many a man who hasn't said half as much as you have
doneâ€”of course, in the public streets, sir."</p>

<p>There was a sickly smile on Flurscheim's face as he
answered: "I hope none of them had such good reason
for cursing as I have."</p>

<p>He did not pursue the topic. With an effort he forced
his mind from contemplation of the loss. "Hadn't we
better leave things in this room untouched, while we
search the rest of the house? There may be some one
of the burglars, if there was more than one, still on the
premises."</p>

<p>The sergeant agreed. But the search was a fruitless one. Mr.
Flurscheim's butler and his four women servants were the only other
persons found on the premises, and after their unsuccessful search the
uniformed members of the force withdrew and the dealer sat down to
await the arrival of the detective with what patience he could summon
to his aid.</p>

<p>It was the bitterest moment in Flurscheim's career.
Despite Lynton Hora's sneer, it was not the monetary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
value of his loss which troubled him, for though he dealt in pictures
and other art objects, yet he never parted with any of his treasures
without a poignant feeling of regret. When he sold them, however, he
knew that they would pass into appreciative hands, that they would
be guarded carefully and preserved jealously. To him they were what
horses are to one man or dogs to another. They were his companions, his
friends, his childrenâ€”and to have the chief of them ruthlessly cut from
its frame and carried away, he knew not where, was as if his household
had been robbed of an only child.</p>

<p>He gazed forlornly at the empty frame. Since the Greuze had come
into his possession, never a night had passed without his taking a last
glance at it before going upstairs to bed, never a morning dawned but
he had feasted his eyes upon it before sitting down to his breakfast.
To live alone without the Greuze seemed to him an unthinkable
existence.</p>

<p>Yet the frame was empty. There took root in his heart
a desire for revenge upon the man who had robbed him.</p>

<p>That thought matured in the days which followedâ€”the
days which came swiftly and passed swiftly, but
without bringing him any trace of his treasure, days in
which the detectives continually buoyed him up with
hopes that his picture was on the ace of being restored to
him.</p>

<p>They had indeed thought that the task would not have proved a
difficult one. Their inspection of the room from which the picture had
been stolen had led to the discovery of a number of clues to work upon.
They decided that an entry must have been effected through a window
which opened upon the portico over the front <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span> door. At that window were a number of
scarlet berried shrubs, and some of the berries were found crushed on
the carpet inside. On the balcony they discovered a palette knife, with
smears of cobalt and chrome upon it, which obviously had been used to
force back the catch of the window. For days afterwards, detectives
might have been observed knocking at the doors of London studios and
offering themselves as models to aspiring Academicians, in the hope of
ascertaining the whereabouts of the missing picture. But they found no
trace of the Greuze.</p>

<p>On the knife-handle too, were unmistakable finger-prints, and on the
empty frame were others. All were photographed, and hope was strong
that the identity of the thief would be disclosed thereby, through
comparison with the records of convicts at Scotland Yard. But when the
first comparison seemed to point to the fact that every print was that
of a different person, and closer investigation proved that the dirty
smudges were not finger-prints at all, the problem became indubitably
more complex. As for the knife which had been used to cut the canvas
from the frame, that was an ordinary table-knife, of which counterparts
might have been discovered in every mean house in the metropolis, and
it supplied no basis for any theory as to the owner. The one fact which
chiefly puzzled Scotland Yard, however, was the fact that no suspicious
characters had been observed anywhere in the neighbourhood, while
the position of the house was such that it was particularly open to
observation.</p>

<p>Standing at the corner of two streets, in a neighbourhood where
all the houses would be described in a house <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span> agent's catalogue as "highly desirable
family town residences," it was under observation from at least three
quarters. The streets at three or four o'clock were at that time
practically empty of all pedestrians save the police. Yet not a member
of the police on duty in the vicinity had seen a suspicious looking
character.</p>

<p>This was the more astonishing, because two extra constables were
on duty that night in the near neighbourhood. They had been detailed
for duty at the town mansion of one of the most popular of society
hostesses, Lady Greyston, who was giving the first of her dances
for the season. Lady Greyston's house was only six removed from Mr.
Flurscheim's, and until three o'clock one of the constables had been
stationed at the corner of the street, practically at Mr. Flurscheim's
front door, in order to direct the carriages arriving to pick up
departing guests. The stream of carriages had thinned shortly after
three, and then the constable had joined a colleague at the door, but
at no time during the night had anything out of the way attracted
his attention. The police were quite at a loss for an object of
suspicion.</p>

<p>But while Scotland Yard was hopelessly at a loss for a clue, the
newspapers had been busy printing stories of the crime, which did great
credit to the fertility of the imagination of the reporters who were
detailed to work up the case. Those who read these stories might have
had warrant almost for believing that each writer must have been the
principal, so intimately and minutely was the crime reconstructed.</p>

<p>But throughout the public excitement and conjecture which the
burglary created, Lynton Hora and Guy remained entirely undisturbed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
or, at the most, merely stirred to mild amusement as each new theory
was evolvedâ€”each was so very wide of the mark. Yet audacious as many of
these theories were, none of them paralleled the audacity of the real
attempt.</p>

<p>How the burglary had been carried out was explained
by Guy when, refreshed by six hours' sleep and a cold
bath, he joined Myra and Hora at the breakfast table.</p>

<p>"I followed your plans almost exactly," he said to the
elder man, "and I found the interior of the house precisely
as you described it."</p>

<p>"Hâ€”m," chuckled Hora, glancing at a print hung
upon the wall opposite him, "that Morland would have
been a cheap investment, even if it had been a fake. As
it isâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"As it is," laughed Guy, "your capital has returned to you more than
a thousandfold. Still I can't help marvelling at your wonderful eye
for detail. You could not have been in Flurscheim's house more than
an hour, and yet I found every wire, every lock, every catch, exactly
where you told me I should find them. Some of the doors and windows you
could never have seen? How could you know?"</p>

<p>"It was not through any capacity for seeing through brick walls,"
said Hora drily. "But merely a deduction from what Flurscheim himself
did not tell me. He was very proud of a system of alarm designed
by himself for the protection of his treasures. He told me that it
was impossible for a window sash to be lifted or an outer door to
be unlatched without setting off the alarmâ€”I observed from outside
that the attics were fitted with swing casements and I drew my own
conclusions."</p>

<p>"You omitted to inform me that the servants slept in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
those attics," remarked Guy. "I nearly stepped on the
bed of one of them when I entered the window."</p>

<p>"So that is why you left by the front door, was it?"
enquired Hora. "It was a little bit risky, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"No," said the young man. "I calculated that I should get a minute's
start, and thirty seconds was quite enough. As a matter of fact, I had
a clear minute. I looked out into the street from a window and saw that
the coast was clear and the brougham was waiting. There were two or
three parties just leaving Lady Greyston's and I calculated upon being
able to join them without exciting observation. The street was very
much in shadow, and just between lights, after a dance, you know, no
one observes very clearly."</p>

<p>"Still it was a risk," observed Hora. "I should have
returned by the way I had gone."</p>

<p>"I still think I took the lesser evil," replied Guy. "Besides
the chance of finding Flurscheim's servants awake, there was the
possibility of being seen from the street as I passed along the parapet
back to the window of the Greyston's house. Then suppose I had met
someone on the stairs at the Greyston's. The function was practically
over. There was every likelihood that some of the servants would be
going to their quartersâ€”it would have been deuced unpleasant to have
had to explain what I was doing there."</p>

<p>"At all events," remarked Hora, "you ought to have
cut off the alarm. Did you forget how to do it?"</p>

<p>A smile flickered across the young man's face.</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I left it in position on purpose. I
thought I should like to give Flurscheim a sporting
chance of getting his own back. There were just two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
flights of stairs and a bedroom door between us. I
thought that if that were not sufficient to enable me to
get away I should deserve to be captured."</p>

<p>Myra, who had been listening to the conversation in silence, half
uttered an exclamation. But she checked it so that only Hora's keen
ears heard. He smiled, but said nothing. Guy continued lazily: "You see
that I did not misjudge the conditions. I am here." Then he repeated
the words he had used a few hours previously. "You must set me a more
difficult task next time, Commandatore."</p>

<p>"What an enthusiast you are," remarked Hora. "If
you go on at this rate, there will be nothing left for you
to do."</p>

<p>"I hate being idle," remarked the young man.</p>

<p>"Never fear, never fear," said Hora, "I have no doubt
you will manage to amuse yourself. You did so last
night, did you not?"</p>

<p>Although the question was asked carelessly, the young
man flushed slightly as he answered: "Tolerably well."</p>

<p>"Only tolerably well?" asked Hora, "and yet you
postponed your enterprise until almost too late, for only
'tolerable' amusement."</p>

<p>"Admitted, Commandatore," answered Guy gaily,
"the adverb is not sufficient. To tell the truth, I met
some very pleasant people, and the time passed swiftly."</p>

<p>Myra sprung the next question.</p>

<p>"Who were they, Guy? Anyone I have met?"</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "A Captain and Mrs. Marven
andâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>He did not get to the end of his sentence. Lynton
Hora had risen from his chair and interrupted him:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
"Who did you say? Say the name again," he cried
hoarsely.</p>

<p>Both Myra and Guy looked at him in amazement. Hora
was not given to showing emotion, and there could be
no doubt but that he was deeply moved. His lips were
drawn closely together, beads of perspiration broke out
on his forehead, every line in his face deepened.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Commandatoreâ€”father?" cried
Guy in alarm, as he sprung to Hora's side and laid his
hand on the elder man's arm.</p>

<p>Hora shook off the touch roughly.</p>

<p>"Say the name again," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Marven," repeated Guy, "Captain Marven."</p>

<p>Gradually Hora regained control of himself. His features resumed
their normal air of petulant acquiescence with the world, but there was
a gleam in his eyes which revealed a very different spirit within him.
Presently he spoke.</p>

<p>"You are surprised to see me so much moved by the
mention of a name. You would not be if you knew what
reason I have to hate the possessor of it. So you found
Captain Marven very good company, eh, Guy?" He
laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," replied the young man.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he mused, "if you would have thought
him as entertaining if you knew the part he has played
in my life."</p>

<p>"In your life?" queried Myra and Guy in the same
breath.</p>

<p>"In my life," repeated Hora with deliberation. Then he continued in
accents which showed how deeply memories of the past rankled: "That is
the man, Guy, to <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
whose actions my quarrel with the world is due. Owing to him I found
every man's hand raised against me. Owing to him I was compelled in
self-defence to raise my hand against every man. Owing to him I became
another Ishmaelâ€”thrust out into the world, branded, a mark for every
man's scorn and every woman's jeers. Oh, I have taken my revenge
upon the scorners," he laughed harshly, "but not upon himâ€”not upon
himâ€”yet."</p>

<p>He paused, and once more, it was only with an effort
that he regained control of himself. He did not again
trust himself to speech. He turned on his heel abruptly.
At the door he paused.</p>

<p>"You have given me much to think about, Guy," he
said. "At present I am unable to think calmly. Some
other time I will discuss the matter with you."</p>

<p>He left the room swiftly and the firm step of his sound
leg and the following shuffle as he dragged the other foot
along after it was the only sound to be heard until the
closing of another door told Myra and Guy that he had
shut himself in his own apartment.

<small>THE MAKING OF A CRIMINAL</small>
</h2>
</div>

<p>The philosophy of Lynton Hora had for once given
way under the stress of a deep emotion. There could be
no doubt about that, and no doubt either that the emotion
which had strained the philosophy to breaking point was
the emotion of hate.</p>

<p>Never before had Guy seen him so wrought upon. Often he had
regretted that the man he called father should have been of so calm a
temperamentâ€”regretted even while he admired. Himself of an impulsive,
even ardent nature, he had longed to express his feelings to the one
being who had been his sole companion from infancy, who had treated
him with unfailing and unvarying kindness, but who chilled, with what
appeared to be temperamental coldness, any expression of affection.</p>

<p>Guy was thrilled with the discovery that a deep sea of
passion underlay Hora's cold exterior. If Hora hated,
of necessity he must love.</p>

<p>He must love him, Guy Hora, his son. Did not every
action in his life show it?</p>

<p>The thought awakened Guy's memory actively. His earliest memories
were of the Commandatore. He had no knowledge of a mother, or but
shadowy recollections, and those might merely be the offspring of
his own imagination. Lynton Hora had been father and mother both.
Guy could recall Hora's face bending over his <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span> bed in the days of his babyhood. He had
one vivid recollection of being parted from his father when he himself
was about seven years old. He had been left in the charge of some
dark-haired, swarthy-faced people, and they had neglected himâ€”had
beaten him. How he had cried for his father, and when his father had
returned, he remembered running to him and sobbing out his tale of
misery. He remembered how Hora had told him that men never cried when
they were hurt, and that he, stricken with shame, had answered that it
was not the beating but the loneliness which had brought the tears to
his eyes.</p>

<p>Hora had smiled and had left him alone for a few minutes. He had
smiled still more when he had returned. Guy remembered seeing the man
who had beaten him later that same day with a bruised face and an arm
hanging helpless in a sling from his neck.</p>

<p>But that was not his most vivid memory of Hora's return. Chiefly it
was a conversation that took place when Hora had taken the boy's hand
and led him up into the mountains. Often the boy had recalled the words
which had been spoken to him. He could never see a pine tree without
their being fresh spoken to his ear, for they had been uttered beneath
the pine woods, on the edge of a translucent mountain lake, which
mirrored the snowy peaks above it so perfectly that it seemed strange
that the pebbles at the bottom could not be counted.</p>

<p>Hora had taken the boy's tears as his text.</p>

<p>"Women weep when they are hurt," he said. "Men strike back. Remember
that, Guy; remember too that if you cannot strike with the arm, there
are other ways of driving the blow home."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>Though Guy had understood the meaning of Hora's words but dimly
then, he had remembered them, and later he understood. Hora had often
given him practical illustration of his precepts. He never forgot an
injury or a slight, and Guy was often allowed to see how Hora avenged
either. Memory has no chronological exactitude, and as Guy allowed
his thoughts to drift, an instance occurred to him which had happened
some years later. They had been travelling in France together and
had been hurrying on to Italy. The one other traveller in the same
compartment had been a blusterous Englishman of the most unpleasantly
self-assertive type. Hora had attempted to engage him in conversation
and had met with a surly repulse. When the frontier was reached, the
assertive person was asleep. Hora had dexterously possessed himself of
the man's watch and when the custom's official made his appearance had
transferred, with equal dexterity, the watch to his pocket, leaving a
portion of the chain visible. When awakened, the Englishman discovered
his loss almost immediately. The official was before him asking him in
a language he did not comprehend, whether he had any dutiable articles
to declare. The visible piece of chain caught the eye of the excited
passenger. He made a grab at the presumed thief. The official, thinking
he was being attacked by a madman, made a wild dive for the door and
reached the platform. The Englishman followed in pursuit and captured
his man. There was a wild melÃ©e, from which the victim did not emerge
victorious. When the train moved on, Hora was gratified by seeing their
late companion ineffectually struggling in the grasp of half-a-dozen
stalwart carabinieri.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>Guy was fifteen years old when this event had happened,
and long before then he had imbibed from his
father ideas of morality which were directly at variance
with those generally accepted. Guy could never remember
a time when Hora had bade him restrain any desire.
How well he recalled a day, he could not have been more
than six, when they had passed a shop wherein a basket
of golden oranges were displayed. "Buy me one," he
had cried. Hora had stopped. There was no one in the
shop. "I'll teach you a new game," he said. "Go and
fetch a couple, Guy. Mind you choose the best," he
said.</p>

<p>Guy had obeyed and Hora had praised him. As Guy ate the oranges
he thought the game the best he had ever heard of. Next day they had
passed the shop and Guy was about to repeat the foray, but Hora had
restrained him.</p>

<p>"Look, Guy," he said. "There is somebody there
now; when you want oranges or anything else without
paying you must be quite sure there is no one about, or
you will lose the game."</p>

<p>Guy remembered the precept and acted upon it. It was a delightful
new game for anyone to play, if you were only clever enough to play it
properly. He used to beg Hora to take him out for a day's stealing,
and sometimes, as a reward for perseverance in his studies, Hora
would accede to the boy's request. He had no notion that he was doing
anything wrong, though he had been taught that there were things he
must not do. He knew that he must not tell his father a lie; he knew
too that he was to be silent when bidden.</p>

<p>Of course a time had eventually arrived when he had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
become conscious that there was some lack of harmony between the life
he and his father led and the lives of those upon whom they preyed.
Hora had taken the boy to see a big penal establishment and his
curiosity had been stirred as to the reason of this gathering of men in
mud-coloured garb, marked all over with broad arrows. "Why are they all
dressed alike? Why do their masters carry guns?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hora had silenced him with a sign at the time, but
later, when they were alone, he had explained.</p>

<p>"They are all men who have been trying to play the game of stealing
and have lost," he said. "If you were to get caught, you would be taken
away and shut up at night in a cell all alone, and dressed in ugly
clothes, and when you went out men with guns would be set to watch you
so that they should shoot you if you tried to run away."</p>

<p>"Have you ever been caught, father?" Guy asked.</p>

<p>Hora had never replied to that question. His face had
grown so dark that Guy had forborne to press for an
answer, and the memory of the singular expression which
had passed over his countenance had been sufficient to
prevent Guy ever repeating the enquiry.</p>

<p>After the visit to the convict establishment, Guy had been timorous
at playing his new game, but Hora had chaffed him, advised him, stood
beside him, protected him, until he became exceedingly dexterous in a
variety of forms of petty larceny. He was never allowed at this time to
mix with other boys. Hora had him always under his own eye, educating
him according to a system which was a fair sample of the average boy's
education as regards matter, but differing vastly from the average boy's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
education as regards the application of the knowledge imparted to
him.</p>

<p>CÃ¦sar was never to him a mere handbook by which the intricacies
of a dead language were revealed, but a wonderful history of a man
who played the game of stealing in a great way. Hora made quite clear
to the boy's mind that there was only a difference in degree between
the stealing of oranges and the stealing of kingdoms, but that if one
wanted to steal kingdoms it was just as well to begin early and learn
the principles of the art by stealing oranges. He explained, too, that
the world looked with very different eyes upon the theft of a crown
and the theft of an orange or an apple. The man who annexed an empire
was an emperor whom men acclaimed and set on a throne in a garb of
purple, while the man who stole a loaf of bread to assuage his hunger
was a petty thief at whom the world hurled opprobrium and thrust into
a prison, garbed in mud-coloured clothes and covered over with broad
arrows.</p>

<p>Guy began to comprehend what Hora intended him to
comprehend, that there was something mean about petty
theft, and he no longer found pleasure in his game, but
turned instead to the weaving of romances of magnificent
depredations.</p>

<p>Even the fiction which was supplied by Hora for the boy's amusement
was insidiously utilised for the inculcation of the same perverted
morality. With Robinson Crusoe, for instance, it was easy for a man
of Hora's equipment to make fun of Crusoe's naÃ¯ve dependence upon
Providence and his exhibition of piety in moments of stress. Hora
pointed out that Crusoe's prayers were mere expression of the terror of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
an uneducated mind when confronted with personal dangerâ€”of a mind which
had been trained in youth to rely upon supernatural agencies for relief
and comfort. He pointed out that Crusoe really secured his own safety
through the exercise of his own constructive and observatory powers,
and through no other agency.</p>

<p>As Guy grew older, Hora sedulously built upon the foundation of
disbelief which he laid down as the basis of the boy's education. Guy
was taught that religion was merely the means by which a priestarchy
levied toll upon the body corporate by playing upon inherited
superstitionsâ€”while history supplied him with plenty of illustrations.
History supplied him, too, with plenty of examples to point the
arguments with which he supported what was in effect a complete
criminal philosophy. Guy was not taught only that atheism was the hope
of humanity. Hora had read much of Nietzsche, and he skilfully adopted
the Nietzschean philosophy to his purpose. A particular appeal to Guy's
mind was to be found in Hora's definition of virtue, as a thirst for
danger and courage for the forbidden. As translated by Hora, both in
precept and in practice, the highest virtue was to be found in the
breaking of laws. He imbibed the doctrines with avidity, for Hora had a
persuasive tongue. He learned at the same time to keep them to himself,
for, as Hora explained, if sheep knew as much as men, men would have no
mutton.</p>

<p>Until eighteen, Guy's education progressed under his father's
tuition, and then, feeling sure of him, Hora thought it time to launch
him on the world. Guy went to Oxbridge to make acquaintance with his
fellows, to survey the flock of sheep which were to supply him with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
mutton in the future. The time then passed pleasantly enough, and
plenty of active exercise supplied him with a vent for his energies. He
did not shear any of the sheep, for Hora had bidden him stay his hand.
A blameless university career would, he knew, be of great value in the
future.</p>

<p>When Guy came down from the University it was with the reputation
of being one of its wildest spirits. Great things were predicted of
him. Others might excel him in individual efforts in the field and
the schools, but none could excel him in fearlessness of demeanour.
Besides, Hora's education had supplied him with a serene belief in
himself, which had been communicated to those with whom he came in
contact. He had been the leader of a set, the model for the freshman,
the autocrat of his time. Like most autocrats, he cherished a profound
contempt for those who bowed down before him. He was to them as his
father was to him, something so much greater than they that their
tribute became merely a thing of no account. He understood why his
father had no affection for him. How could anyone love the thing
beneath; the moth could love the star, but the star could not love the
mothâ€”andâ€”â€”</p>

<p>Guy awoke from the reverie into which he had been betrayed by his
father's emotion on hearing the name of Captain Marven mentioned. He
was quite alone. Myra had left the room after vainly trying to engage
his attention. His hand unconsciously sought his pocket, and, when he
drew it out, he held in his palm the snuff-box he had reserved for
himself from the booty he had brought home on the previous night. He
gazed earnestly at the miniature set in the lid.

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>"So Captain Marven is father's enemy," he muttered,
"and thisâ€”this must be a portrait of Captain Marven's
daughter."</p>

<p>His face grew troubled. His brow puckered. He
thrust the box back into his pocket and rose impatiently
from his seat.</p>

<p>"Bah!" he said, "what says the Commandatore?
Man is trained for war, and woman for the relaxation of
the warrior; all else is folly."

<small>THE REFLECTIONS OF LYNTON HORA</small>
</h2></div>

<p>There was undoubted reason why the name of Marven should move Lynton
Hora to emotion. It swept him back over the thirty years which bridged
him from his youth. He would not have answered to the name of Hora in
those days; the days when he and Richard Marvenâ€”"Gay" Marvenâ€”had been
subalterns together in the same cavalry regiment. But the name he had
borne then was buried and forgotten long since, and the young man who
had borne it was dead to the knowledge of the world, though his virtues
and his sins, his memories and hatredsâ€”most certainly his hatredsâ€”lived
actively in the recluse connoisseur and antiquarian, Lynton Hora.</p>

<p>He had had good reason for burying his earlier selfâ€”an
all-sufficing excuse for blotting out his existence
from his regimental companions, from the friends of his
youth, from the parents who had wept over his downfall
perhaps even more than they had mourned the presumed
death which had followed his punishment.</p>

<p>The name of Marven had brought vividly before his mind a picture of
the bitterest moment of his life. Never could the memory of that moment
lose the poignancy of its sting. The hollow square in the barrack yard,
the epaulets he had once worn on his shoulder lying on the ground, the
look of scorn on the faces of his brother officers and reflected on the
faces of the men who had been till then beneath him,  for the convicted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
thief, he saw these things clearly at the mention of Captain Marven's
name.</p>

<p>He had always held that Marven was responsible for his dishonour,
Marven who had everything which he, Hora, had desired and which fate
had denied him. On the day he had first met him envy had entered into
his heart. The contented smile on Marven's face, the expression which
declared that everything is the best possible in the best possible
world, had irritated him. Hora had not shown his irritation! Early in
his youth he had learned to control the expression of his feelings. But
companionship had deepened the irritation day by day. Gay Marven was
the most popular man in the mess, Hora the least. Marven was wealthy,
a credit to a smart cavalry regiment; Hora's allowance barely sufficed
to meet the bare necessary expenditure, and so he was debarred from
indulging in the extravagances which his comrade affected.</p>

<p>Some of them sneered at him and Hora attributed the
sneers to Marven's influence, though wrongfully, and his
irritation became anger.</p>

<p>Later, a greater cause of jealousy arose through the interposition
of the essential feminine element in all drama. Hora had fallen
hopelessly in love, and he had reason to think that the affection he
had bestowed would be returned. Then Marven appeared on the scene, and
Hora's hopes had vanished. Marven had only to be natural to dazzle the
eyes of all beholders with the rays of his sunshiny disposition. Hora's
temperament was of an intellectual coldness more likely to provoke
esteem than love. The attack of aerotitis which affected both of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
them accentuated in each his natural characteristics. Marven became
more brilliant than ever, Hora more passionately reserved. Then Hora,
his natural judgment in suspension, had imagined that it would be
possible to out-dazzle Marven. Reckless of consequences, he joined in
all the pursuits from which he had hitherto stood aloof. His useful
charger had been replaced by two magnificent mounts. His tailor had
been made temporarily happy by a swiftly swelling account. He had
begun to entertain lavishlyâ€”a year's income, apart from his pay, would
not have met one single week's expenditure. He had known that the
pace could not last, but fate had been kind to him at the outset. He
had speculated on the turf and had won. From the card table, too, he
rarely rose a loser and the play that went on in the card room of the
mess, when the Colonel was not there, would have genuinely shocked the
commanding officer, had he been aware of the amount of the stakes at
issue. Hora's comrades thought he had come in for a legacy, and he was
no longer deemed a discredit to their ranks.</p>

<p>Though delayed, the day when the inevitable reckoning was to be
met could not be averted forever. When fortune frowned, instead of
smiling upon his turf speculations, he was forced to visit the Jews.
There he could obtain but trifling accommodation, for he had never had
any expectations, and was heir to nothing but an unstained name. Even
the five hundred pounds he had ultimately raised was only advanced at
ruinous interest on a three months' bill. He had plunged more wildly
than ever. He had lost. He had become short of cash to meet his daily
out-of-pocket expenses. Even then, he might have been saved from utter
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
extinction had not he imagined that he had succeeded in putting his
rival in the shade. He had staked everything upon one last hazard.
There had been under his control certain regimental funds. He had
made use of them, knowing full well that so soon as his anticipated
engagement was announced he would have no difficulty in obtaining a
further loan, since the object of rivalry between Marven and himself
was wealthy, as well as beautiful. With that loan he had counted on
being able to replace the money he had embezzled. But Marven was before
him, and the day Marven's engagement to Beatrice Challys was announced
an unexpected investigation of Hora's accounts by the Colonel of the
regiment disclosed the defalcation. Hora was placed under arrest, and
the torrent rushed over him.</p>

<p>When he had reached his own apartment, Lynton
Hora spared himself not a single pang of bitterness of
the memories of what had followed. The weary days
under arrest, the long-drawn-out inquiries, the court
martial, the day of the promulgation of the sentence,
when he was drummed out of the regiment, and had
walked out of the barrack yard into the hands of the
civil police, who were awaiting him to bring him to
further trial.</p>

<p>He had been spared nothing. There was no influence which could
have been exerted to save him from any one of the ignominies which he
had incurred. He had supplied an excellent example for exhibiting the
impartiality of the law. No private in the ranks should be able to say
that he received harsher treatment than the officer of a crack cavalry
regiment.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>He had faced his punishment bravely, indeed, he had welcomed the
solitude of the cell when he had eventually exchanged his cavalry dress
for another of H. M.'s uniforms. There he had not to meet the scorn of
men's eyes.</p>

<p>One by one he recalled the incidents. They had never ceased to
pain him, even though he tried to laugh at his weakness in imagining
that the wound to his pride still rankled. But he would not have been
without that smarting sore. He took the same fierce satisfaction in the
pain with which the martyrs of Smithfield solaced themselves as they
thrust their arms into the fire. He told himself always that the mental
suffering, the intolerable scorn he had faced, had shown him the world
as it is, and not as it pretends to be. He postulated a deceitful,
hypocritical world with a smile on its face for the man of wealth, and
a frown and a brick for the poor devil who had the will to enjoy and
not the means to gratify his longings.</p>

<p>Before his disgrace he had hated only one manâ€”afterwards he hated
all men, and at least one womanâ€”she who preferred Gay Marven, fortune's
favourite, to himself, fortune's scapegoat. But in addition to enabling
him to appreciate the smiles and frowns of the world at their proper
worth he told himself that his experience had made a man of him. It
certainly left him a purposeful, resourceful, scrupleless being, with a
definite object in existence.</p>

<p>That object was revenge. Revenge on the world
which had scorned him, revenge on the world which had
labelled him criminal, revenge above all upon Marven.</p>

<p>He had made all his plans long before his sentence had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
expired. He saw that he must die to the world if the future was to
have any promise at all, for a past, such as his, would have been an
incubus no man might carry for long. So, when his term of imprisonment
was over, he disappeared in the broad light of day. At least the
ex-convict disappeared from English eyes when he sculled out to sea
in a fair-weather craft from a south coast watering-place. A day or
two later the overturned boat was picked up with the ex-convict's coat
still entangled in the seat, and with his ticket-of-leave still in the
pocket. There was nothing to connect the Lynton Hora who a few weeks
later landed from an English tramp steamer at an Italian port with the
missing man.</p>

<p>Hora had not found existence present many difficulties. He had
buried his scruples with his identity, and a man of brains, with
courage and no scruples, need never look very far for the means of
subsistence. For a while he preyed on British tourists. They were of
his own race, and, therefore, his chiefest enemies, and, besides,
he knew that, since he would need a place where he might build a
reputation and a new identity if his purposes were to be fulfilled,
it would be unwise to prey upon the inhabitants of the selected spot.
Italy appealed to him. He became to all intents and purposes Italian.
An English soap-maker's wife, "seeing" the Eternal City, supplied him,
unwittingly, with funds to purchase a vineyard in Tuscany. He stocked
his farm and furnished a house with the contents of a duchess' jewel
casket. The capital necessary for pursuing his agricultural operations
was provided indirectly by the Casino authorities at Monte Carlo. Hora
had ventured no stake at the tables. He had merely relieved a successful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
gambler of his winnings. Thus provided with a home,
he had paid a visit to England. When he returned, six
months later, he brought his reputed son with him, a
child of three; and away in England, his old comrade,
now Captain Marven, together with Mrs. Marven, had
mourned beside an empty cot in their nursery.</p>

<p>Hora had succeeded in the initial step towards the accomplishment
of his revenge. But this had been only the first step. His appetite
was not to be sated with one simple meal of vengeance. His rival, like
himself, should never be allowed to forget his loss. So punctually
every year, on the anniversary of the stolen boy's birthday, Marven had
received a brief type-written note stating that the child was alive
and wellâ€”nothing more. Hora would gladly have signed the note with
his forgotten name, but that thereby he might have incurred danger to
himself and the overthrow of his whole scheme of revenge. When the
appointed time came, when the child was full grown, when by his own
acts the child should be damned beyond all redemptionâ€”then the woman
who had refused his offer of marriage should have her son restored to
her, the rival who had won that woman's love from him should have the
paternity of the criminal thrust upon him, and the whole world should
be made aware of Guy's real parentage. That was the complete scheme
of revenge Hora contemplated; to consummate which he had instilled
into the baby ears the subtle poison of his perverted morality, had
skilfully taken advantage of the boy's adventurous nature to interest
him in the romantic possibilities of a criminal career, had laboured
and watched the unfolding of a mind with the patience of a Japanese
gardener producing a dwarfed and twisted miniature of a fair
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
tree of the forest.</p>

<p>He had been discreet in his work. He had no intention
of making of his pupil a rod for his own scourging. His
conception of the great criminal he desired to make of
Guy had nothing in common with the average conception
of a person given to indulgence in all the commonplace
vices of humanity. Self-control he had early realised
was of more importance to the man who was
waging single-handed warfare with the world, than to
the units of the community with whom he was at issue.
His own predilections, too, were instinctively refined.
The grosser forms of self-indulgence had never appealed
to him. He was an epicure of life, and had no desire
to spoil his palate with a surfeit of coarse pleasures. Clean
living himself, he demanded cleanliness of life in those
about him. To what happened outside of his own household
he was cynically indifferent.</p>

<p>Guy had proved a credit to his training. He was healthy in body,
full of the enthusiasm of living, and possessed of a fine rapture for
the profession to which he had served his apprenticeship. Almost the
time was ripe for the consummation of Hora's revenge, when chance had
brought Guy into contact with his real parents. This was a contingency
Hora had not foreseen, and it needed careful consideration. He did
not fear that the relationship would be disclosed. Guy himself had no
suspicion of the facts. He knew no parent but Hora, though he believed
that he remembered the mother whom Hora had invented for his benefit,
whose portrait hung on the wall of his bedroom, and of whom Hora had
spoken to him on many occasions. Yes, Guy Marven's real identity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
was sufficiently sunken in that of Guy Hora to ensure him against
discovery, even though physical likeness should lead to comment.</p>

<p>Yet, Hora's first emotion, on learning that his foster-son had met
his father and mother, was one he thought he had banished forever.
A sensation of fear had passed over him, a dread lest the natural
inclination of son to mother should manifest itself, lest the blood
which pulsed eagerly in the son's arteries should cry out to the blood
which ran more sluggishly in his father's veins, and, his own mock
relationship disestablished, there be destroyed the living instrument
for his revenge he had spent so many years in fashioning. Nor had
his only fear been for the loss of his whole scheme of revenge. He
realised, for the first time, that his interest in Guy was more than
that of the artist in his artistry. Guy had always looked to him, had
repaid him for his attention with all the warmth of an affectionate
nature. He was the one being in whom, save Myra, Hora had taken a
personal interest. Suppose someone else were to take his, Hora's, place
in the young man's thoughts? The dread was in his mind, though he would
not acknowledge itâ€”though he denied its existence. That would be a
piece of sentimentalism utterly foreign to his whole nature. He told
himself that he had no affection for the child of his adoption, save
that of the master craftsman in his tool. Of course he would regret the
necessity, when it arose, of giving the tool to destruction, but he
would admit to himself no warmer interest in Guy's fate than that.</p>

<p>Self-persuaded on the point, he considered whether the
meeting, of which he had been apprised, might not be
utilised for the furtherance of his plans. Nor was it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
long before he became persuaded that Fate was playing into his hands.
Supposing that the acquaintance developed into intimacy. A thousand
vague possibilities floated, shadow-like, before Hora's eyes. He
determined that the acquaintance should be continued, but still
fearful, he determined also that Guy should be plunged more deeply into
the vortex of crime than hitherto, so that, struggle and strive as he
might, he should find it impossible to escape. Fortunately for his
purpose, Guy had expressed himself as hungering for further adventure.
Well, Hora was fertile of plans, and he saw very good reasons why Guy's
desires should be humoured. His household saw nothing more of the
Commandatore that day. He remained alone with his thoughts.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br>
<small>THE COMMANDATORE MAKES A DEDUCTION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>"We are getting near the end of our resources, Guy,"
remarked Hora quietly, as he held a glass of port up to
the light, sipped the wine, nodded his head approvingly,
and set the glass down gently.</p>

<p>It was the evening of the second day after Hora's exhibition of
emotion upon hearing the name of Marven. He had not referred again to
the object of his hatred, and neither Myra nor Guy, who sat with him at
the table, had prompted his memory.</p>

<p>Guy looked round the room before he answered. He
had been well trained in the observance of caution. But
the servants had retired, the door was closed. The three
were alone.</p>

<p>"All London offers replenishment of our empty coffers,"
he answered light-heartedly. "Who is to have the
honour?" He turned to Myra. "Shall I peel a peach
for you?" he asked.</p>

<p>The woman seemed not to hear the question. She was
looking at Hora, with an appeal in her glance.</p>

<p>Hora answered her glance. "Myra is tired of London,"
he remarked. "What do you say, Guy? Shall we
finish the campaign now, strike our tents and retire like
contented bourgeoisie to our vineyard to watch the grapes
ripen?"</p>

<p>Guy's eyebrows arched in surprise. "Retire empty-handed?"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
he asked incredulously. "Why, what has
come upon you, Commandatore?"</p>

<p>"Myra is tired," he answered briefly.</p>

<p>Guy looked, smilingly, at her. She flushed slightly.
"Not a bit of it," he answered. "I am quite sure she
does not desire to exchange the delights of a London season,
even for the <i>dolce far niente</i> of an Italian summer."</p>

<p>"I should not mind," she answered. "London is a
beastly place. The Commandatore is right. I am sick
of the sight and sound of people, and of the perpetual
menace of our lifeâ€”Iâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Hora checked her speech with a gesture. The door
opened and a servant entered with coffee, and while he
was present the conversation passed lightly over topics of
the day.</p>

<p>"I don't like that man," said Guy, as the servant withdrew. "I
caught him prying about amongst my belongings the other day when I
returned to the flat unexpectedly."</p>

<p>"All servants do that," murmured Hora indifferently. "Curiosity is
the mental badge of servitude. The servant is never happy until he has
surprised one of his master's secrets. It would be just as well, Guy,
if you were to supply him with a few facts to exercise his imagination
upon. Get some girl to write you a few love letters and hide them where
he can find them. He will never be at a loss then to supply a reason
for any erratic movement of yours."</p>

<p>Guy laughed. "Not a bad suggestion," he agreed.
"Do you adopt the same plan to protect yourself?"</p>

<p>Hora shrugged his shoulders. "I carefully built up
my own reputation in advance," he remarked. "Haven't
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
I told you? I suppose not, for you were both too young
when I first located myself here." He looked round the
pleasant dining-room complacently. "I've had the place
for ten years now, and for one's name to be for ten years
in the London directory, at the same address, is a certificate
of respectability which is not easily discredited."</p>

<p>"Still I wonder that you did not seek greater privacy,"
remarked Guy, as he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Hora smiled. "A decision for privacy always awakens suspicion, and
thus in our profession privacy <i>de facto</i> is perhaps the one
luxury we cannot afford. Nevertheless a greater degree of privacy is
possible in the midst of a crowd than would be possible anywhere else
in the wide world. This is not such a paradoxical statement as it
sounds. In the crowd no one is intent on the doings of his neighbours.
Put a ring-fence round a man, and every eye would be fixed upon him.
Thus you see my reason for selecting a residential flat for my London
residence. The servants are not mine. Each of them has half a dozen
other objects of curiosity. When they have attended to our requirements
they disappear."</p>

<p>"But, nevertheless, they must be curious concerning
the contents of the art gallery?"</p>

<p>The allusion was to a portion of the abode into which the servants
were not supposed to enter. Though situated on the eighth story, Hora's
flat at Westminster Mansions was not the ultimate achievement of the
builder. Above were attics to which a narrow staircase gave entrance.
The stairs were shut off by a door, and the door was always locked.</p>

<p>"When I see any signs of curiosity I always take an
early opportunity of gratifying it," said Hora. "Every
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
one of the servants who has ever waited upon me has had the privilege
of inspecting that chamber, and not one of them has ever been
sufficiently interested to enter it a second time, except at my
especial request. You see they are all aware why I took possession
of the attic. They think it is the fad of a nervous invalid. Those
attics were entered from another staircase when first I took the flat,
and some of the servants slept there. I complained of the noise,
continually. Half a dozen of the poor devils must have been dismissed
at one time or another for purely imaginary offences in consequence.
Then I declared I could stay no longer, and I gave notice to leave.
The agent for the landlord was apologetic, and asked if there was no
way in which he would not be able to meet me. I offered to rent the
place, saying that I would make it into a storeroom for the books and
trifles which I am continually accumulating. He jumped at the offer I
made, and I know he thought me a fool." Hora chuckled. "How surprised
he would be to learn that the proceeds of many a rich haul have been
stored there for months. But I have drifted away from my original
point. I was telling you of the manner in which I built up my original
reputation for eccentricity, the safest cloak a man may wear. It was a
simple matter. I merely answered for myself the references I gave to my
landlord. I described myself as an unfavourable tenant from every point
of view, but the pecuniary one. My habits I described as irregular, my
requirements exacting to a degree, my manner brusque and overbearing,
and my disposition faddy and changeable, and further said I was given
to making continual requests for structural alterations in any dwelling
place that I occupied in order to make accommodation for any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
new collecting craze which seized me."</p>

<p>"I wonder any landlord ventured to accept you,"
laughed Myra.</p>

<p>"The London landlord has a high opinion of his capability for
withstanding the demands of his tenants," said Hora drily. "He is a
man lavish of promises, but meagre of fulfilments, and possessed of a
genius for extracting the uttermost farthing of his rent. Moreover, he
would take Satan himself as a tenant if he offered to pay six months'
rent in advance. Naturally I proved acceptable, and not turning out to
be the terror I depicted myself I am now looked upon as the best tenant
in the whole building. I am free to do as I like. My treasure-house
ceases to excite curiosity, and I believe if I were to place the crown
jewels upon one of the tables up there they would be undisturbed, so
long as my rent was paid regularly, until they were hidden beneath the
accumulated dust of ages."</p>

<p>The allusion gave Guy an idea.</p>

<p>"Do you contemplate an imitation of Colonel Blood's
exploit for the replenishment of our empty exchequer?"
he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"I have often envied Blood's opportunities," answered
Hora thoughtfully, "but at the present day there are
much greater difficulties in the way than Blood had to
contend with. Some day, perhaps, but just now I have
another scheme in my mind." He rose from the table.
"I have something to tell you," he remarked. "You will
excuse me for a minute."</p>

<p>He left the room. As the door closed on Hora, Myra
turned eagerly to her companion. She felt that, despite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
her promise to Hora, she must give utterance to the
fears which once again possessed her mind.</p>

<p>"Guy," she said, "I wish you would persuade the
Commandatore to leave London for a while. He would
listen to any wish of yours."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" he asked. "I don't think that
any expression of mine would turn him from any purpose
he has in view."</p>

<p>"But can you not try?" she persisted. "For my sake,
Guy."</p>

<p>"Why, whatever is the matter with you, Myra?" asked the young man,
his attention captured by the obvious anxiety in her voice. "Surely you
are not becoming afraid?"</p>

<p>"Becoming afraid?" she repeated after him mechanically.
"No, I am not becoming afraid. I learned what
fear was long ago, when first I ventured to put my own
desires in opposition to the will of the Commandatore.
I have always been afraid since then." She fell to
silence.</p>

<p>"There's no reason to fear the Commandatore," answered
Guy cheerfully. "You are growing morbid,
Myra."</p>

<p>She paid no heed to his comment. "It is not fear now,
or at least not what is generally understood by fear.
There is an oppression in the air, the weight of something
unseen and unknown presses on me."</p>

<p>"But there is nothing for you to fear. Whatever were
to happen you would be quite safe," argued Guy.</p>

<p>"Myself? It is not myself I am thinking about," she
cried passionately. "Whatever impends does not
threaten me. It is you, Guy, I fear for. Ever since the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
night of Lady Greyston's dance I have felt it. I thought
you would never return that evening, but you came back,
and for a while I could laugh at my fears. But, now
the Commandatore has some other proposal to make,
my dread has returned. I shall not have a moment's
rest."</p>

<p>"Why this is sheer hysteria, if not madness," said
Guy in great concern.</p>

<p>"Call it what you like," she replied earnestly, "but
listen to what I sayâ€”promise me!"</p>

<p>She heard Hora's lagging footstep in the passage outside, and she
ceased speaking suddenly. "Not a word of this to the Commandatore," she
said hastily, as the door opened, and Hora re-entered.</p>

<p>If the elder man observed that his re-entry had broken
in upon a confidence from which he was excluded, he
gave no signs of having done so. Myra breathed more
freely when he seated himself again at the table, and
spread out a newspaper he had brought with him on the
table.</p>

<p>"There are three items of news in this evening's paper," he remarked
quietly, "which supply the data from which may be deduced the means
whereby an enterprising man may build a fortune."</p>

<p>Guy was all attention on the instant, and Myra, viewing
his keen face, let her head droop upon her hand.</p>

<p>"Those items are?" queried the young man, as Hora
paused.</p>

<p>"You will find the first in the Court News," was the reply. "The Rt.
Hon. Sir Gadsby Dimbleby, who is the minister in attendance upon His
Majesty the King, arrived at Sandringham last night."

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span></p>

<p>"The Minister of Foreign Affairs, is he not?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>Hora nodded, and turned to another page from which he read: "Just
before the close all markets sagged badly on selling orders from
Berlin. A variety of rumours were afloat as to the reason, but no
definite information which would supply justification for a bear raid
on the market was forthcoming from any well-informed quarter. In
the street, afterwards, prices were put up again generally, though
fluctuations were considerable."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Guy, beginning to look puzzled.</p>

<p>"The third item is a mere addition to the Reuter's telegram from
Australia, giving particulars of the cricket match between the English
and Australian teams. The result is placed in the space left for late
news, and over it are the words "delayed in transmission.""</p>

<p>Hora ceased speaking.</p>

<p>"If the rehabilitation of our fortunes depends upon
translating that puzzle we shall end our days in the workhouse
yet," said Guy.</p>

<p>"Yet, there is much wealth for the man who can piece
together those scraps of information, and will act promptly
on the knowledge," answered Hora.</p>

<p>"How? By speculation on the Stock Exchange?"
asked Guy. "I thought, Commandatore, that you eschewed
all forms of gambling."</p>

<p>"I do," said Hora drily. "But to buy and sell on a certainty has
nothing of the gambling element about it. I feel inclined to make
either the bulls or the bears contribute to our maintenance. But
action must be prompt if it is to succeed. There is work for you to do
to-night, Guy, if you care about it."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>"Care about it?" The young man sprang to his feet,
every fibre of his frame quivering for action.</p>

<p>Hora laughed good-naturedly. "Thereâ€”there, Guy,
take matters a bit easily. There's plenty of time before
you yet, if you decide to go on with the job. It's more
risky than the last."</p>

<p>"The greater the risk, the better I shall be pleased,"
exclaimed Guy, as he dropped again into his chair,
"though how you are going to evolve anything of a risky
nature from those paragraphs you have just read, I entirely
fail to understand."</p>

<p>"You'll understand soon enough," remarked Hora quietly, "and you
will then be surprised that the meaning of these three items of news
should have conveyed so little to you. Let me reverse the order and
read into these three facts my own conclusions. What can be the reason
for the delay in the transmission of the cable containing the cricket
result? Either the cable had broken down, or it was monopolised for
more important work. The former theory is untenable, for if you take
the trouble to compare the time of the insertion of the news with
the time when it should have been inserted, you will find a delay of
three or four hours only has to be accounted for. Thus I arrive at the
decision that the cable was fully occupied by someone with a prior
claim for its use. Who could that be? Here again the choice is between
two possibilities. Either some big financier or body of financiers or
the Government. Again the indications point to one conclusion. The
City was merely uneasy by reason of German selling, which could not be
accounted for, and not because of information which had come over the
wires. Therefore, the wires must have been occupied by important
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
despatches to the British Government. I think," said Hora, "that if
the knowledge of what has passed over the cable is in my possession by
to-morrow morning, we shall be in a position to spoil the Egyptians of
Throgmorton Street to some purpose."</p>

<p>Guy looked at Hora with admiration. Some idea of
his companion's purpose dawned upon himâ€”but only
faintly. He asked eagerly for further guidance.</p>

<p>"As to the nature of the despatch which has been received at the
Foreign Office, I have no more idea than yourself," he continued,
"though it probably affects Germany, and it is hardly worth while
troubling to guess. I am only concerned with times, places, and people.
As I calculate, the cable was not clear for ordinary business until
close upon six o'clock. Six would, therefore, be very near the time
when the end of the message was delivered at the Foreign Office.
Of course it would have been cabled in the official cypher. By the
time the message would be de-coded there is only one train by which
a special messenger could take the de-coded despatch to his chief,
who happens to be the minister in attendance upon His Majesty at
Sandringham."</p>

<p>Hora looked up at the clock. "That train starts from St. Pancras
at 9.50. It proceeds as far as Lynn, where the messenger carrying the
despatch will probably be met by a motor-car. It is just nine o'clock
now, Guy, so there is plenty of time for you to decide whether it is
worth while making an effort to obtain the information which will be in
his despatch box."</p>

<p>Guy's eyes sparkled. "It's worth while trying any
way, Commandatore." He turned to the young woman.
"Wish me luck, Myra," he said.

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br>
<small>WHEREIN A KING'S MESSENGER IS DESPOILED OF HIS
DESPATCHES</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Guy had ten minutes to spare as he stepped out of the cab at St.
Pancras Station, and, handing a bag to a porter, made his way leisurely
to the booking office and took a ticket for Lynn. He would have been
easily recognised by any of his acquaintance, for he had made no effort
to disguise himself. Hora professed no liking for physical or material
disguises, contending, indeed, that such were merely the clumsy devices
of incompetence. "The man who anticipates being seen in any affair in
which he is not prepared to meet scrutiny is anticipating failure,"
he was accustomed to declare. "In all other cases," he had told Guy,
"your own identity will be your most certain protection. A bourgeois
reputation for wealth and half a dozen society acquaintances will
provoke apologies from inquisitive persons when a mere hint that you
had dyed your moustache would mean instant arrest." Guy was disposed to
agree with him. He disliked the theatrical, as much as he was enamoured
of the dramatic, aspect of his profession.</p>

<p>Yet on this occasion he had not been long on the platform before
he was betrayed into the wish that for once he had assumed some
disguise. The porter to whom he had entrusted his bag had deposited it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
in the corner of a first-class smoking compartment, and Guy strolled
along the waiting train, glancing into each compartment in turn, in
order to locate the messenger who, if Hora's deductions were correct,
was to travel by it. He had made no plans as to the means he was to
take to obtain a knowledge of the despatches. Nor had Hora made any
suggestions.</p>

<p>"I leave the matter entirely in your hands, Guy," he had said. "If
you see a favourable opportunity, take it. Opportunity only passes
by the unobservant. Still, such may be lacking, and if none presents
itself do not strive to make one. One failure in our profession is the
end of a career. I don't want to see your career cut short yet. It is a
difficult task you have undertaken, and I shall not be surprised if no
opportunity presents itself. Don't think I shall blame you."</p>

<p>The words were in his mind, as he passed coach after coach, and
saw no one who seemed at all likely to be the messenger bearing the
despatches. He returned to the door of the compartment where his bag
lay. A porter came to the door, glanced in, then opened the door of the
next compartment, and pasted a little label "reserved" on the window.
Guy, standing on the platform, looked at the entrance a dozen yards
distant. He became conscious of a little thrill of excitement in the
thought that Hora's deductions were likely to be proved accurate. It
was the next instant that he wished that he had concealed his identity.
A passenger made his appearance and the moment their eyes met Guy
recognised him, even as he knew he was himself recognised. It was too
late to seek retirement in the train. He stood still while the newcomer
advanced with outstretched hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>"Guy Hora, if I'm not mistaken, by all that's lucky.
Going anywhere on this train, eh?"</p>

<p>Mechanically Guy took the offered hand. There was
no need for him to attempt to infuse any surprise into
his voice. He could only ejaculate "Captain Marven!"</p>

<p>"Himself," said Marven, "and as much surprised to
find a friend here as you are." He glanced into the compartment
where Guy's bag remained.</p>

<p>"Unless you want to sleep undisturbed, I should propose
that we travel together," he remarked.</p>

<p>"If I might intrude," begun Guy hesitatingly.</p>

<p>"Intrude? You don't know how delighted I shall be,"
said Marven heartily. He beckoned the porter who stood
holding open the door of the reserved compartment.
"Put this gentleman's bag in here," he said. "Now,
jump in," he continued to Guy.</p>

<p>The young man obeyed. The porter closed the door, touched his
cap, and turned away. Captain Marven tossed a bundle of magazines on
the seat and settled himself in a corner. "Better to look upon than
magazines is the face of a friend on a five hours' journey," he said
laughingly.</p>

<p>"Much better," replied Guy. His first surprise had been succeeded
by a second much greater. Captain Marven's coat had swung back as he
entered the compartment, and Guy had observed beneath it a despatch
case. It flashed upon him that Captain Marven must be the carrier
of the despatches. There seemed to be something uncanny in Hora's
prescience. Fate had given him the opportunity which the Commandatore
had declared awaited the observant, and it remained for Guy to take
advantage of it. But there was a bitter thought commingled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
with the realisation of the fact that the opportunity he desired had
been given to him. This man had seemed so friendly disposed towards him
from the moment they first met. There seemed to Guy to be something
particularly mean in an act of treachery towards him. But he had no
opportunity to brood upon the thought, even had he desired to do so,
and he did not desire to contemplate it. Besides, not to take full
advantage of the opportunity would be treachery to the Commandatore,
who was depending upon his success. Guy put aside his new-born
scruples, and concentrated his attention on the business in hand.</p>

<p>He perceived that he would have to make use of all
his faculties if he were to succeed in his object. The
man opposite him would not be easily cozened. But the
effort must be made. He began to turn over in his brain
a variety of plans, while he chatted with his companion.</p>

<p>The whistle sounded, doors banged, the train moved out into the
night. There was no escape now. But how was he to gain possession of
the case in Captain Marven's possession without exciting suspicion? As
a stranger, there would have been greater chance of effecting the coup
by some sudden stratagem. But, positioned as he now found himself, he
was practically helpless unless Marven should sleep. Guy looked up at
the Captain's face. It was an alert face, not the face of a man who
sleeps while on duty. It would be difficult to evade the glance of
those cool, grey eyes, trusting as they seemed. The firm mouth and the
set of the jaw told of a character that would not be amenable to sudden
panic. Captain Marven was obviously a soldier. How could it be that he
was carrying despatches for the Foreign Office? What if he were mistaken?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
The thought startled the young man from his reverie to hear his query
answered.</p>

<p>Captain Marven was speaking to him, and he had missed the opening
remark. "It's unusual for me to find one of our own set as companion on
my frequent journeyings," he said, "though, of course, one does run up
against friends, occasionally."</p>

<p>"You travel a lot then?" asked Guy mechanically.</p>

<p>"It is the business of a King's messenger," answered
Marven drily.</p>

<p>"I didn't know," remarked Guy in genuine surprise, while the thought
flashed into his mind that the despatches must be important indeed,
since they had not been entrusted to the care of one of the ordinary
officials of the Foreign Office. "I had no idea that you belonged to
that select body."</p>

<p>"Nearly twenty years in the service, my boy," answered
Marven. "If I were a motor-car my mileage
would be considered something extraordinary, but being
only a manâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>He ended the comment with a laugh.</p>

<p>Guy echoed it.</p>

<p>"I understood that you wereâ€”â€”" He was about to add, "a man about
town like myself," but checked himself. Marven laughed and finished the
sentence. "A good-for-nothing idler like yourself, eh, Hora? No," he
continued. "I was once. Indeed, to my eternal regret, I left the army
when I ought to have been thinking seriously of it as a profession.
But I had everything I asked of life then, and I rather chafed at my
duties. Later"â€”a shadow passed over his faceâ€”"I felt a need
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
to do something which would keep me away from thoughts whichâ€”I wanted
some work with movement in it, and, having plenty of influential
friends, I found myself a superior sort of postman."</p>

<p>Almost the elder man had been betrayed into a confidence. Guy,
realising this, again felt a thrill of distaste for the task he had in
hand. Then he wondered if the thoughts from which the King's messenger
desired to escape were in any way connected with the events which were
responsible for the Commandatore's hatred. After all, this man was the
enemy of his, Guy Hora's father. The enemy through whose actions Lynton
Hora had found himself in conflict with the world. Guy hardened his
heart. Most possibly the genial mask of friendship which Captain Marven
wore was the ordinary disguise of hypocrisy. Guile should be met with
guile.</p>

<p>It was with a manner as frank and a smile as confiding
as his own that Marven found his questions responded to.</p>

<p>Indeed, he was genuinely interested in the young man. He had already
discovered at their first meeting that he was of an intelligence beyond
the ordinary. He had observed that Guy had been strongly attracted
by the niece whom his wife was chaperoning for her first London
season, and he thought that it would be well if he could know more of
her admirer. But, beyond all that, Captain Marven had observed what
Guy's younger eyes had missed. He saw in the younger man something
which reminded him of himself in his own youthful days. A likeness of
feature, of carriage, of manner. The belief that one day the son, his
only child, would be restored to him had been an abiding one. It had
been partly responsible for his adoption of his present profession.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
Somewhere his son was growing into manhood. Any day he might meet
him.</p>

<p>He made the most of his wide knowledge of the world to secure the
young man's confidence, and flattered himself that he had succeeded.
He was quite unaware that Guy, though wondering at his curiosity, was
responding to his advances in furtherance of his own objects. Guy
talked freely of his boyhood. He spoke with filial affection of his
father, and of the mother he could just remember, and, as he revealed
the particulars of his parentage, Captain Marven's half-formed hopes
withered, and he told himself that his expectancy had given to the
young man a family likeness which had no existence outside his own
imagination. So the train rushed on through the night, bearing father
and son, sitting face to face, yet unrevealed, and while the son
plotted to rob his father of the despatches which honour bade him guard
with his life, the father looked at him again and again, saddened with
the thought of another hope shattered.</p>

<p>The train sped on, stopping now and again to pick up the mails.
Conversation languished. Guy had decided on his course of action.
He determined to try a plan which if unsuccessful, would leave him
time for a second attempt, a plan, the feasibility of which, he had
frequently discussed with his mentor, Lynton Hora.</p>

<p>He surprised Captain Marven in a yawn. "Getting
sleepy?" he asked.</p>

<p>Marven smiled. "I don't sleep to-night until my journey
is ended."</p>

<p>"What martyrdom to duty," scoffed Guy. "I am almost
inclined to save you from yourself."</p>

<p>Marven looked at him questioningly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>"By demonstrating the power of hypnotism," explained
Guy briefly.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Captain Marven laughed. "I am afraid you
would not find me an amenable subject," he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Guy. "It is astonishingly easy
to induce hypnotic sleep."</p>

<p>Marven smiled doubtingly. He held the belief that hypnotism was
a mere vulgar device of charlatans to impose upon the gullible. He
expounded his views to Guy at length. The young man, stimulating
opposition, by assertion and counter-assertion, at last declared that
if Captain Marven would only lend himself to the experiment he would
speedily prove to his satisfaction that there was substantial grounds
for belief in the realty of hypnotic force.</p>

<p>Captain Marven, serenely satisfied of his invulnerability and
amused at Guy's obstinacy, professed his willingness to submit to any
experiment Guy might suggest. Guy appeared to hesitate at the prompt
acceptance. He declared that he was unprovided with the necessary
materials. Marven chaffed him, seeing in his reluctance doubt in his
own beliefs. Guy remembered that he had in his handbag a small electric
torch with a reflector attached which might serve the purpose of the
mesmeric disc commonly used. He produced it.</p>

<p>Marven, lounging comfortably in his corner, was bidden to divest
his mind of all thought and gaze intently upon the glowing point of
light. With a keen sense of the absurdity of the proceeding, the King's
messenger conscientiously endeavoured to obey the instructions given
him. Silence reigned in the compartment, for two, three, four minutes.
Then Guy rose from his corner, and stood over his companion, every nerve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
quivering with the intensity of his purpose. He laid his hand lightly
on Marven's head.</p>

<p>"You are beginning to feel sleepy," he said.</p>

<p>Marven did not contradict him. Already his brain had wandered far
afield from the thoughts which had employed it when he had first fixed
his gaze on the brilliant point of light. He had forgotten that he was
the subject of an experiment. He was dreaming again, dreaming that his
son was found, and that they were going home together. It was such
a pleasant dream that he would not raise his eyes lest it should be
shattered, as such dreams had always been shattered before. Perhaps he
was feeling sleepy. Well, what of it? Surely there was no reason why he
should not sleep?</p>

<p>"You are feeling very sleepy," said Guy. He was
watching Marven's eyes closely, and observed that their
lids drooped heavily.</p>

<p>"You will not keep awake much longer," he said.</p>

<p>The point of light seemed suddenly enlarged. It filled
Marven's field of vision. No, he would not be able to
keep awake much longer.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am very sleepy," he replied. The voice was
mechanical.</p>

<p>Guy's heart bounded triumphantly. His experiment
was succeeding beyond his wildest anticipations. At the
most he had hoped to be able to gain the opportunity to
instil a suggestion into a half-drugged consciousness,
which would facilitate his obtaining possession of the
despatches, but now it seemed that he was on the point
of entirely subjugating his companion's consciousness.</p>

<p>"You must close your eyes," he said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>Marven obeyed.</p>

<p>"Stand up," commanded Guy.</p>

<p>Marven raised himself to his feet, but his eyes remained
closed.</p>

<p>"You cannot lift your right arm," said Guy.</p>

<p>Some remnant of will yet remained. The hypnotised
man strove to raise his arm. But the effort was a failure,
the arm half-lifted from the elbow dropped again.</p>

<p>"Sit down and sleep comfortably until I awaken you,"
commanded Guy.</p>

<p>Marven obeyed. He lay back in his corner. His eyes were closed,
his breathing calm and even. To all appearances he was asleep. Guy
seated himself and gazed at the man opposite. Was his experiment indeed
successful, or was Marven merely shamming with a view of ridiculing
his efforts? He inclined to the former belief, yet the ease with which
Marven had succumbed was in itself suspicious. It would be easy to
apply a test.</p>

<p>Guy rose, and, drawing aside the overcoat which Marven wore,
deliberately unbuckled the strap upon which the despatch case was
slung. The Captain never stirred. He was really asleep. Guy looked
at his watch. In another ten minutes the train would be stopping at
Cambridge. Yes, he had just time to carry out the initial stage of his
plan. From his handbag he produced a mass of stiff modelling clay,
and with it he took two impressions of the seals which secured the
fastenings of the case. Then he placed the case and the impressions in
his own bag. Already he was beginning to enjoy the consciousness of
success.</p>

<p>The train ran into Cambridge railway station. Guy
leaned over to his sleeping companion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>"You must have a cup of coffee if you are to keep
awake," he said.</p>

<p>The Captain's eyes opened, but they were dull, unseeing.</p>

<p>The train stopped. Guy alighted and Marven followed
him to the refreshment room. Guy ordered coffee. Marven
drank his mechanically.</p>

<p>"We must return," said Guy. "The coffee will not
keep you awake long."</p>

<p>The guard was standing at the door when they re-entered
their compartment, and he closed it deferentially.
Evidently he was aware of Captain Marven's identity.
Guy was glad that he had taken the risk of awakening
Marven; otherwise the railway official's acquaintance
might have proved troublesome.</p>

<p>The train rolled out again into the night.</p>

<p>"You will sleep again," said Guy soothingly.</p>

<p>The Captain composed himself in his corner, and Guy forgot him.
Seconds only passed before the despatch case was open before him, seals
broken, lock picked, and the papers it contained lying in his hand.
He groaned as he saw the voluminous character of the document. Then
his eyes brightened as he caught sight of the prÃ©cis of the contents
attached. A fountain pen and paper were at his hand, and a copy of the
prÃ©cis was soon in his possession. Then watch in hand he read the more
lengthy despatch. Ten minutes had passed since leaving Cambridge and
another ten would bring the train to Ely. He returned the papers to
the case. With deftness, born of much practice, the lock was turned
again. With a spirit lamp the wax of the seals was melted and the seal
reimpressed by aid of the carefully oiled clay impression already
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
hardened sufficiently for the purpose. With a sigh of satisfaction Guy
laid the case on the seat. But the sigh died away. Looking up he was
astounded to find that Captain Marven had awakened, and was standing
erect and with outstretched hand was pointing to the case.</p>

<p>There came upon Guy the impulse for instant flight. But whither?
The impulse did not remain long in possession of him. He saw that
Marven was striving to speak and could not find words, and at the same
moment he realised that his victim was only partially awakened from the
hypnotic state. Collecting all his faculties for a supreme effort Guy
faced him.</p>

<p>"You cannot stand up," he said. "You cannot awaken
for two minutes yet."</p>

<p>The Captain hesitated. He seemed to be fighting against an
overpowering desire. But insistently Guy repeated his commands, and
with a despairing gesture, Marven sank back once again into his
corner.</p>

<p>Guy waited no longer. The moment Marven was quiescent, he rebuckled
the case to the strap, and disposed it beneath the Captain's coat. Then
he clapped his hands smartly before the sleeping man's face and cried
loudly, "Wake up, Captain Marven, wake up."</p>

<p>Marven came back gradually from his trance. He
rubbed his eyes, he looked wonderingly about him.</p>

<p>"What have you to say about hypnotism now?" asked
Guy.</p>

<p>Captain Marven looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"Iâ€”I don't quite understand. Do you mean to say
that I have slept?"</p>

<p>The train ran into Ely Station.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>"Hullo! Where are we? At Cambridge already?"
asked Marven.</p>

<p>Guy laughed. "This is Ely," he answered.</p>

<p>"Ely?" repeated the Captain incredulously.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ely," answered Guy. "Don't you remember
stopping at Cambridge and going with me to the refreshment
room for a cup of coffee to keep you awake?"</p>

<p>"Stopping at Cambridge," repeated Marven more incredulously
than before.</p>

<p>"It is a fact," answered Guy, and he added, "I hope
you will forgive me having given you so practical an
exposition of the fact that there is something in hypnotism
after all."</p>

<p>Captain Marven did not answer immediately. He seemed to be
struggling for recollection. "I have no remembrance of that, butâ€”â€”" By
an instinctive gesture his hand sought the case beneath his coat. His
face lightened as he felt it there. "I've been dreaming, nevertheless,"
he said. "I seem to remember that something in my charge was in your
possession, and that although I struggled to regain possession of it I
could not do so."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was the last impulse of your will to combat the
effort I was making to gain control of it," remarked Guy, secretly
congratulating himself that he had been in time to prevent Marven's
complete awakening before the case had been returned to him.</p>

<p>"No doubt that is the explanation," replied Marven,
rising and throwing open the carriage door. He stepped
on to the platform.</p>

<p>"Are you not going to stretch your legs, Hora?" he
asked. "We have twenty minutes here."</p>

<p>Guy joined him, and they paced the platform together.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
They chatted on indifferent topics. Then Captain Marven
suddenly sprang a personal question.</p>

<p>"By the way, Hora," he said, "if it's not impertinent
to ask, what made you choose this infernally slow train
to come to this part of the world?"</p>

<p>Guy had long had a lie prepared.</p>

<p>"Laziness," he answered lightly. "I missed the earlier
one which would have taken me on to Hunstanton, where
I have an appointment to-morrow morning. I found that
I should be able to get on from Lynn in time to keep it,
and so here I am. I'm glad I missed the fast train, as it
has happened. I hate travelling alone."</p>

<p>Captain Marven made no reply. Guy could see that he was not
satisfied, but he gave no hint that he had observed anything, and, when
the journey was resumed, he kept up an easy flow of talk until Lynn was
reached.</p>

<p>Then he bade Captain Marven good-bye, and, if the King's Messenger
had any suspicion regarding the companion of his journey, there was no
hint of it conveyed in his parting greeting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br>
<small>MERIEL MAKES AN IMPRESSION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Captain Marven was certainly not at ease in his own mind in regard
to the experience on his journey. He seemed to remember awaking, and
seeing in Guy's possession the despatch box that he carried. Yet in
view of the fact that it was still buckled to the strap, the suspicion
seemed absurd. As soon as he was alone he carefully examined the
despatch case. The seals were to all appearances intact. He missed
none of his personal belongings, and was ashamed of the suspicion
which prompted his hurried search through his pockets. Really he had
no reason to suspect Guy Hora of any ulterior object in hypnotising
him. He recalled all the circumstances. At his own invitation Guy had
travelled with him, he himself had pressed his companion to make the
experiment. He had lost consciousness while Guy was sitting opposite
him, and when he had regained it, Guy was still opposite him, and
certainly did not exhibit the slightest trace of trepidation. But what
had happened in the forty minutes interval which had elapsed between
the losing and regaining of consciousness. Guy had told him that
they had alighted at Cambridge and had drunk a cup of coffee at the
refreshment room. But was that all? He could not banish the thought
of the dream which had come to him during that hypnotic slumber, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
vision of Guy Hora bending over the despatch case doing something to
the seals, and of himself standing powerless to interfere with him. Was
it only a dream? Yet it were foolish to suppose otherwise. What could
the despatches he carried contain of interest to the wealthy young man
about town, who seemed to him so like what his own son might have been?
It was a puzzle which he could not elucidate, though it engaged his
attention during his long motor drive to the royal residence; it was
present in his thoughts when he placed the case in the hands of the
Secretary of State, who, warned by telegraph of his coming, was waiting
up for him, and he could not escape it even when he himself sought
repose. It was the first thought in his mind when he awoke the next
morning.</p>

<p>If he had been gifted with clairvoyant powers, he would not have
needed to flog his brains for a solution. Could he have seen Lynton
Hora gloating over the transcription of the cypher telegram which had
reached him that morning from Guy, Captain Marven would have had an
inkling of the truth. Could he later have seen Lynton Hora sending off
wires to brokers at Paris, Berlin, and New York, could he have heard
Lynton Hora instructing his London stockbroker over the telephone, he
would have been still nearer a solution. Finally, could he have heard
the Foreign Secretary's remarks later in the day, when a detailed
account of an unfortunate incident in the South Pacific, in which a
German gunboat and a British cruiser were concerned, appeared in an
evening paper, he would have known that in some mysterious manner the
information contained in the despatches he had carried had become known
to the world.</p>

<p>Yet, though he knew not, nor could have known, any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of these things, yet the vague uneasiness that there had been intention
in Guy's presence on the train was not easily dispelled. It begot in
him a still greater desire to learn something more of the young man
whose face haunted his thoughts, and when he returned to town the next
morning, carrying with him the answers to the stolen despatches, it
was with the fixed intention of cultivating Guy's acquaintance, if the
opportunity offered.</p>

<p>The chance he desired was not long presenting itself.
A week had not elapsed before they met again. The
meeting was a purely casual one. They recognised each
other at the opera. Guy occupied a stall and the Captain
was with his wife and niece in a box. At the end of the
first act Guy left his seat. The Captain met him in the
foyer.</p>

<p>"Been trying any more experiments in hypnotism?"
was Marven's greeting.</p>

<p>Guy shook his head and laughed. "I haven't been
upon any railway journeys with unbelievers," he replied
jestingly. He met the Captain's glance fearlessly, and
again Marven felt ashamed of his suspicions.</p>

<p>"I was just coming to pay my respects to Mrs. Marven
and Miss Challys," continued Guy.</p>

<p>The Captain turned to accompany him. "You need
not tell the ladies how easily you bowled me out," he
remarked. "I have been so blatantly cynical on the subject
always that I should never hear the last of it."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly not," answered Guy, smiling. The Captain's attitude
dispelled the last chance of his being connected in any way with the
acquisition of the information which, when it had been made public, had
created the most intense excitement. Clearly the Captain wished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
no one to know that he had allowed himself to be placed in an hypnotic
trance while on duty, and Guy, for his own protection, was more than
ready to fall in with the suggestion to keep silence concerning the
episode.</p>

<p>"After all, it is a purely personal matter of absolutely no concern
to anyone but our two selves," he added, as they reached the box.</p>

<p>Conveying his thanks with a nod, Marven opened the door, and, as
Guy entered, all thought of the Captain passed from his mind. Only
once previously had he met Meriel Challys, but the impression which
she had produced upon him was one that would not easily be eradicated.
He had first seen her floating towards him on some booby's arm at Lady
Greyston's dance. Who the booby was and what the booby looked like
Guy had not the faintest idea. He had no time to spare a glance for
anyone else, once his eyes had rested on her face. But the man on whose
arm she leaned so lightly must of necessity be a booby. Any mere man
could be nothing but a booby in comparison with any personality so
exquisitely ethereal as that given by nature to Meriel Challys. Guy had
determined to take the place of that booby himself. He had enquired
amongst his friends until he had obtained the introduction he desired.
He had received one waltz and he had sat out one square dance in the
plumbago bower at the end of the long gallery. He would never forget
the fair picture she made, draped in maiden garb of white, her dazzling
skin and hair framed in the tender blues of the drooping blossoms.
It had been an effort for him to speak to so distractingly beautiful
a subject, and it had been only the fear lest she should think him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
moonstruck which had forced him to unlock his lips. No wonder that
the despoiling of Mr. Flurscheim's treasure-house had been postponed.
Indeed, had the treasures been spread before him at that moment, Guy
would have passed them by unnoticed.</p>

<p>That first impression of instinctive reverence had not endured. A
fervid disciple of Hora's cynical philosophy could not remain for long
in a state of ecstatic adoration of one of the sex provided "for the
relaxation of the warrior."</p>

<p>But now, entering again into her presence, his first
impression was revived with redoubled intensity. Again
he saw her coming towards him. He remembered the
Tennysonian line which flashed into his memory at first
sight of her:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">"Robed in white samite, mystic, wonderful."</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>No, that did not do justice to Meriel Challys, and yet
it might, perchance, describe her in some moods, he
thought; and though there was nothing mystic in her
mood when Guy had been introduced, yet the swift
impression was mayhap nearer the truth than the later
one.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marven greeted him warmly. They chatted a little while, then,
as Guy turned to the girl, she became a silent observer. The family
likeness which her husband had observed in Guy was equally apparent to
herself, but she had not given words to the vague thoughts which had
risen up in her mind when she had first seen him at Lady Greyston's
dance. Such thoughts were best crushed down at onceâ€”they only invited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
disillusionment. Not for worlds would she have suggested to her
husband that the young man had awakened in her the crushed down
maternal instinct. The mere hint would have made him uneasy. She even
dreaded lest he should have recognised for himself certain physical
resemblances which certainly existed between her husband and Guy. She
had no idea that he had recognised them, and was as loth as her husband
himself to give words to her imaginings, for precisely the same reasons
which imposed silence upon him. Each in point of fact had felt the
promptings of the parental instinct, and each in tenderness for the
partner of his and of her sorrows and joys forebore to awaken by a word
the memory of the great sorrow which had early cast its cloud over
their married life.</p>

<p>Lynton Hora had always been hopelessly wrong when he had imagined
that but for the rivalry of Marven he would have won the affection
of Beatrice Challys. So far as he was concerned she had always been
heart-whole. But from the day she had met Dick Marven there had only
been one mate for her in the whole wide world. The affection had been
mutually bestowed. Marven lived for his wife, even as she lived for
him. In each of their thoughts the one object for consideration was
their <i>alter ego</i>. Marven would have sacrificed anything to save
his wife a momentary pang, physical or mental. She would have inflicted
any torture upon herself that he might be spared even momentary
uneasiness. But this kindly consideration for each other's feelings did
not always prove unexceptionable in practice. Impalpable, diaphanous,
there was a barrier of reserve ever between them from the day their
first born and only child had been mysteriously spirited away. In so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
far Hora's scheme for revenge had been successful in action. It had
shadowed the lives of both the parties upon whom his blow had fallen,
and, though in tender consideration for each other, his action had
brought them closer together, yet it had also operated in placing
between them the barrier of a subject they dared not discuss.</p>

<p>The maternal instinct, deprived of its natural outlet,
of necessity had found another vent. Robbed of her
son, Mrs. Marven had taken to her heart a brother's
child, who had been orphaned early in life. The girl
had repaid the devotion lavished upon her, and, if Mrs.
Marven could never quite banish the regret for her lost
son, she would always have heartily admitted that Meriel
Challys had brought sunshine again into her life. Meriel
was all that a daughter could be, and a very tender sympathy
existed between her and her aunt.</p>

<p>Naturally the latter could not have failed to observe the admiration
which Guy Hora exhibited toward Meriel. It was patent in his every
glance, and he made no effort to conceal it. He approached Meriel with
the proud assurance of the man who feels that he has the right to lay
the tribute of his admiration at the feet of the woman whom he admires,
and is not ashamed of letting the whole world perceive upon whom his
choice had fallen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marven liked the attitude, which was so different to that of
many of the admirers whom Meriel had already, in the course of her
first season, gathered in her train. It awakened memories, too, of the
days when Richard Marven had wooed her. His face had worn the same
unconscious air of adoration. Almost Mrs. Marven's heart stood still,
as she watched Guy's face as he stood leaning forward looking into
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
Meriel's eyes, answering her smiles with his own; the likeness was so
vivid to the memory she bore in her heart. She would have liked to step
forward and claim him. Her heart cried out "My son, my son," but the
words died on her lips. She crushed them back, though the effort left
her lips pale.</p>

<p>Meriel, looking towards her, noticed the pallor and
with a hasty, "You are ill, Auntie," was at her side.</p>

<p>"I find the theatre a little close," murmured Mrs. Marven. "If
we might have the door of the box open a little." She refused all
suggestions that they should leave the opera house, and, before the
attempts to persuade her were completed, the curtain was rung up, the
lights were lowered, and the opera proceeded.</p>

<p>Guy remained in the box. Mrs. Marven sat back in
the shadow studying his face intently. When the second
act ended, she had regained full control of her emotions,
and could make light of the supposed indisposition with
which she had apparently been attacked. She pressed
Guy to remain in the box for the remainder of the evening,
and he was nothing loth to accept the invitation.</p>

<p>There, then, he remained, unconscious that he was the centre of
interest to the two elder members of the party, unstirred by any
instinctive emotion towards them, and with every thought, every
faculty, strained to make the most of the flying minutes which gave him
Meriel's company. He was unable to solace himself with the assurance
that she responded to the emotions which were aroused in himself by her
presence. She was purely natural, no spice of affectation spoiled her
glance or her smile. Indeed, at times she seemed to be unconscious even
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
of his existence, enthralled in the melody of the music, responsive
only to the rhythm of the throbbing strings. Guy could hardly
understand her rapture. Romeo et Juliette, even with world-famed
artists to sing the title rÃ´les, had already ceased to awaken him to
passionate wonder. The naÃ¯vetÃ© of the girl's enjoyment surprised him,
and he wished that she might for once have forgotten the music for
him.</p>

<p>Yet, if he had possessed the power to peer into the girl's heart,
Guy would have found that his own image was already stamped there;
that it was his presence which was the inspiration to enjoy; that,
unknowingly, imperceptibly, the tiny seed of love had been planted
in her maiden bosom, needing but the passage of the hours before it
should spring up into the perfect plant of a pure woman's first love.
But, though Meriel knew not of the implantation, she was conscious of
the additional thrill in her delight. The whole world was now become
perfect to her. She thought the sense of beatitude was the product of
the sensuous melody of the opera.</p>

<p>There was no discordant note anywhere. The evening promised to pass
in joy unalloyed. A fly dropped into the ointment. She looked up and
met the glance of Hildebrand Flurscheim. To her it was at first the
mere casual glance of a complete stranger from a near box. But there
was something compelling in it. When she glanced in his direction again
he was still gazing steadily at her. She drew herself back into the
shadow. But the exhilaration of spirit had passed. She felt compelled
to look again in the direction of the stranger. He was still watching.
When the act was ended, she turned almost petulantly to Guy.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me who that man is? The Jew staring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
at us so persistently from the fifth box on the right?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Guy glanced in the direction she indicated, but before
he answered Captain Marven spoke:</p>

<p>"The fifth?" he said. "That's Flurscheim, the chap who lost the
Greuze the other day. It's reported," he added meditatively, "that
he has sworn that he will devote the whole of the rest of his life
if necessary to tracking down the rascal who has robbed him of his
picture."</p>

<p>There was a smile on Guy's face as he answered:
"He doesn't expect to find it at Covent Garden, does
he?"</p>

<p>Despite the smile, however, he was conscious of a vague sense of
uneasiness at the persistent scrutiny which Flurscheim was bestowing
upon the box. There are times when the fear of being found out bears
a marvellous similarity to the prickings of conscience, and certain
inward twitches which he felt made him supremely uncomfortable.
Hitherto he had always been able to justify his actions by means of
Lynton Hora's philosophy, but now he realised in a flash that he
would not longer be satisfied by justification in his own eyes. Could
he justify his deeds to the satisfaction of the pure-browed girl by
whose side he stood? Would she accept the doctrine that since virtue
consisted in a thirst for danger and a courage for the forbidden,
the highest virtue was to be found in the breaking of laws? He knew
instinctively that she would not, that in her eyes he would appear
no heroic figure engaged in single combat against a host of enemies,
but the despicable figureâ€”a furtive, cringing, creeping figureâ€”the
despicable figure of a thief.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>He left the box with his thoughts in a turmoil. He scarcely observed
the particular warmth of the farewells with which both Mrs. Marven and
Captain Marven took leave of him. He hardly noticed that Meriel's hand
had lingered a moment in his grasp. He felt that he must be assured
that Flurscheim had not been watching him.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br>
<small>A SUCCESSFUL SPECULATION AND ITS RESULT</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Lynton Hora felt that Fate had dealt generously with him when it
made Captain Marven the bearer of the despatch case which Guy had
so ingeniously rifled of its secrets. Guy's success had supplied
him with all the information necessary to bring off a magnificent
coup on the Stock Exchange. He had speculated heavily for the fall
in the securities of both countries. He knew that publication of
the information he had in his possession would make his operation
successful. He had not scrupled to publish that information, though its
disclosure before its discussion between the chancelleries of the two
nations concerned brought two great powers to the verge of war.</p>

<p>It found its way into the newspapers, and while the press of two
countries breathed defiance, Hora laughed in his sleeve, cynically
declaring that no farce is equal to the farce of civilisation, since
nations are as ready to fly at each other's throats as any street
curs. And while the newspapers snarled and patriots in beer houses and
at street corners sang national anthems, Hora watched the prices of
securities, and when the crisis reached its acutest stage, he bought
in his bear and found himself possessed of what to the majority of men
would have been a sufficient provision against the future.</p>

<p>But Guy's successful action had done more than lead to the swift
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
accumulation of a fortune. Hora had not for a moment anticipated the
long arm of coincidence would be stretched to such purpose as to make
the father the bearer of the despatches which the son had stolen. It
was the crowning stone in the carefully built arch which was to bear
the superstructure of his revenge.</p>

<p>Hora felt almost superstitiously inclined regarding the coincidence.
He did not learn of the identity of the messenger until Guy's return
from Lynn, and, as soon as it was made known to him, he saw how the
fact could be made to serve his purpose. Naturally he said nothing of
that ulterior purpose to either Guy or to Myra. He was merely full of
praises for his pupil. He declared himself to be so satisfied that
he expressed his intention of making the young man master of his own
actions for the future. "You have enabled me to provide for myself,
Guy," he said. "It is now my turn to provide for you, so that if at any
time you desire to retire from your profession you will be at liberty
to do so."</p>

<p>Guy had ridiculed the suggestion, but Hora had insisted. "Who knows
what may happen in the future," he said. "It will be well for you to
have money at your own disposal. You may quarrel with me. To-day sons
always quarrel with their fathers. Sometimes they rob them, and if
fathers were wise they would always see that their sons are spared the
necessity."</p>

<p>Guy laughed. He felt that he was not of the commonplace world of
sons who robbed their fathers, but he gave way to Hora's whim. He
instructed a broker on his own account, though the operation was not
in his own name. Hora had suggested that it would be just as well
if for the occasion Guy borrowed another surname. So the letter of
introduction he forwarded to Hora's broker <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span> introduced "my young friend Guy Marven,
upon whose information I am acting, and who, wishing to speculate on
his own account, I am prepared to guarantee up to Â£10,000." Accordingly
it was as Guy Marven that he signed in due course the transfer notes of
stock which came to hand, and it was with the name of Guy Marven that
he endorsed the cheque which he paid into his own banking account as
the result of the speculation.</p>

<p>He had wondered that Hora should have selected the name of Marven
and had even suggested the inadvisability of making use of it since
Jones, Brown, or Robinson would have been equally useful if the
necessity existed to use another than his own. To him it seemed that
the use of the name Marven might excite remark. "Exactly why I wish you
to use it," Hora had answered. "If anyone who was aware that Marven
carried those despatches should hear that a Marven had been speculating
for the fall, it would not be remarkable if they should arrive at the
conclusion that he had looked inside his case himself."</p>

<p>"That seems rather rough on Captain Marven," remarked
Guy. It seemed a mean deed, and Hora had not
trained him to take delight in mean deeds.</p>

<p>"Isn't he my enemy, and therefore yours? You have no reason, I
suppose, for treating him with more consideration than all the rest of
the world?" demanded Hora.</p>

<p>Guy did not answer. He was tempted to reply with a direct
"no," but he had never yet lied to Hora. Yet he could not bring
himself to confide to the Commandatore the reason why he would have
extended consideration to Captain Marven. He had no wish to hear the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Commandatore's biting cynicisms applied personally to Meriel. The
idea seemed sacrilegious. He was relieved to find that Hora made no
comment on this silence. But the Commandatore had not failed to observe
it, and remembering at the same time how Guy had nearly let slip the
opportunity for securing the Greuze in the seductive companionship of
these same "pleasant people," he realised that the time had come for
him to discover what the attraction was. Of course he guessed. The
miniature set in the snuff-box which Guy had expressed a desire to
retain had not escaped his notice.</p>

<p>"The inevitable feminine," he said sneeringly to himself. But he
knew that the inevitable feminine has always to be reckoned with where
a young man is concerned, and generally where an old man is concerned
also. It behooved him to know something of this new factor, which might
materially affect his plans. But Guy must have no suspicion that he
was under observation. Hora's mind jumped to an expedient whereby his
object would be secured without subjecting himself to inconvenience.
He determined to make the suggestion which had occurred to him
forthwith.</p>

<p>"There's another matter which I have been giving
thought to, Guy. Don't you think that it is about time
you took some chambers for yourself?"</p>

<p>Guy was more than startled by the suggestion thus
sprung upon him. He had always been left such perfect
freedom that there had never been the slightest temptation
in the thought of possessing a domicile of his own.</p>

<p>"Why, Commandatore?" he asked. "I am perfectly
comfortable at home here."</p>

<p>"You will always be at home here, I hope," replied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
Hora, "but at the same time there is much to be said in
favour of the course I am proposing. Now listen, Guy.
I will say nothing of the extra freedom which will be
yours."</p>

<p>"I could not have more than I enjoy at present," remarked
Guy.</p>

<p>Hora shrugged his shoulders. "Men are men," he
said. "You may be having visitors who might hardly
like to come here. Eh?"</p>

<p>Guy smiled.</p>

<p>"I see it is possible," continued Hora, smiling in his turn. "Then
there are others whom I might not wish to meet. The men of your own
years with whom you mix, with whom you must mix if you are to keep your
position, will probably be often dropping in on you. I am getting of an
age, Guy, when I might find their presence, I will not say distasteful,
but just a little wearisome. At chambers of your own you will be much
freer in that respect."</p>

<p>"There are my clubs," objected Guy.</p>

<p>Hora waved the objection aside.</p>

<p>"Then there is the additional reason of our joint safety to be
considered," continued Hora meditatively. "It seems to me that if you
are located in a place of your own we shall be provided with another
strategic centre from which to carry on operations. You see it might be
important for the safety of both or either of us that we should not be
living under the same roof."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I see your point there," replied Guy, and
he became thoughtful.</p>

<p>"Think it over, Guy," said Hora, and he left the young
man.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Guy thought it over, and was surprised when he did so that the idea
proved so attractive. It was not that he was ungrateful. He could not
believe that the daily companionship of Hora was becoming distasteful,
and yet there was certainly relief in the thought that he should be
apart from the man whom he called father. How greatly this thought was
due to the impression that Meriel Challys had produced upon him he did
not appreciate, but the knowledge that if he were settled in a home of
his own he might perhaps escape taking part in any plans for revenge
which Hora might be weaving about Captain Marven, was certainly a
powerful consideration.</p>

<p>When, therefore, Hora broached the subject again after dinner that
night, Guy was quite prepared, nay, even eager, to fall in with his
views. Hora was more than ever convinced that some unknown factor was
influencing his adopted son.</p>

<p>The only voice raised in protest was Myra's.</p>

<p>"Youâ€”you are going away? Why?" she asked.</p>

<p>There was a tremor in her voice which made Hora
intervene hastily.</p>

<p>"It is my wish, Myra," he said. The woman shivered
at the menace of his tone. But it produced the result
Hora desired. She quelled the emotion that struggled
for utterance, and listened in silence while Hora reiterated
the reasons which he had already given to Guy.</p>

<p>But though dumbly acquiescent she did not believe
in Hora's statement as to the motives which animated
him, and when, after Guy had left them, she was alone
with Hora, she returned again to the subject.</p>

<p>"Why are you sending Guy away?" she asked. "Is
it to avert danger from yourself?" There was scorn
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
in her tone. Hora made no attempt to avert the threatened
emotional storm.</p>

<p>"Have I ever feared danger?" he asked sneeringly.</p>

<p>"I've never known you to face it. I don't know anything
about your feelings," she replied.</p>

<p>Hora looked at her. She had never dared so to speak
to him before, and he knew that she must be greatly
moved to so provoke his anger.</p>

<p>"You know nothing," he replied calmly. "A woman
is utterly unable to comprehend a masculine point of
view."</p>

<p>"A woman cannot live in the same house with a man
and fail to know something of his character, and I know
something of yours, Commandatore."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders in amused surprise.</p>

<p>"You find me an interesting study, Myra?" he
drawled. He could not have said anything more calculated
to arouse Myra's tempestuous spirit.</p>

<p>"Interesting?" she exclaimed. "I don't know about that. You don't
interest me in the least. Iâ€”Iâ€”hate you."</p>

<p>"Dear me!" replied Hora equably. "I might have expected you to do
so. Perhaps I have, for there's undoubtedly wisdom in the suggestion
that one does not pluck figs from thistles, though the saying is
somewhat hackneyed."</p>

<p>"You need not throw my origin in my teeth, Commandatore," she
replied. "I am sufficiently conscious of it, and as for gratitudeâ€”well,
I often think I should have been far better off in the slums from which
you picked me. I should have been happy enough. The precious education
you have given me has only enabled me to <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span> realise my own impossibility. You have
given me knowledge, and with it the capacity for suffering."</p>

<p>"Like your mother Eve," responded Hora quietly,
"you longed for the apple and blame the serpent."</p>

<p>"Eve was no child, and I was a child when you gave
me the apple," she answered more quietly.</p>

<p>"That is true," replied Hora. "Possibly I did
wrongly. I should have left you to bloom in your own
soil. You would have been overblown by this time,
Myraâ€”some drunken ruffian's doxyâ€”taking your weekly
beating without a whimper and seeing heaven in a quartern
of gin."</p>

<p>"Better thatâ€”better thatâ€”thanâ€”â€”" She paused.</p>

<p>"Well?" asked Hora. She muttered something sullenly,
but in so low a tone that the words did not reach
his ears.</p>

<p>He continued, "You were asking me why I think it
well that Guy should have a home of his own. I have
given you my reasons. I really should have thought
you were intelligent enough to realise their force."</p>

<p>"I don't believe in them," she flashed out. "Oh, I know you better
than that, Commandatore. I know your subtle methods. You have some
other end in view. What it is I know not, but I am sure it means danger
to Guy." She had been moving restlessly backwards and forwards, but now
she paused and faced Hora. "I tell you, Commandatore, that if anything
happens to Guy you shall not escape. I swear it."</p>

<p>Despite his apparent unconcern Hora was impressed
by the latent passion in her tone. Almost he regretted
that he had not left the beautiful flower to be choked by
the weeds from which he had plucked it. But he remembered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
that he had one means of controlling Myra which
would necessarily prove effective. He rose from the
chair where he had been sitting. "If anything happens
to Guy, I don't suppose I shall care much what happens
to myself," he replied gravely. "Is he not my son?"</p>

<p>"Your son?" replied Myra. "I doubt it, Commandatore.
No father would ever have brought up a son
as you have brought up Guy. Besides, there is nothing
of you in him. I know you both. There's not a feature
alike, and the difference between your thoughts
and actions and his is just as strongly marked."</p>

<p>"You are talking nonsense, Myra," he said harshly, far more
perturbed than he cared to confess at the discovery by which the
woman's intuition had arrived at the truth.</p>

<p>"You may call it nonsense," she continued wildly,
"but there's no blood of yours in Guy's veinsâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Hora checked her. He laid his hand on her shoulder,
and though she made an effort to throw off his grip he
held her tightly and thrust her down into an easy chair.</p>

<p>"You little fool," he said, "you don't know what you
are talking about. Like all women in love you let your
imagination run away with you."</p>

<p>She still struggled ineffectually to escape from his
grasp while he continued. "Suppose I had other motives
than those I have given to you and Guy for desiring that
he should live apart from us for a little while, have I
ever by any chance done anything which could bring
danger upon him? Did it never occur to you that one
of my motives had connection with yourself?"</p>

<p>She ceased to struggle. Her hands dropped limply
by her side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>"I might have known, I might have known," she
cried; "and yet, Commandatore, you promised me that
I should have my chance."</p>

<p>Hora saw that he had won the battle. He loosed his
grip of Myra's arm and returned to his chair.</p>

<p>The girl rose and following him dropped on her knees
before him. The tears were in her eyes and her bosom
rose and fell stormily. "You promised me I should
have my chance, Commandatore. Don't send Guy away.
I cannot bear it. Indeedâ€”indeed, I cannot bear it."
Sobs choked her utterance.</p>

<p>Hora allowed her to weep awhile. Then he laid his
hand gently on her bowed head.</p>

<p>"Poor little woman," he said, "if you could only see
an inch beyond your own nose, you would realise that I
am giving you your chance now."</p>

<p>She looked up incredulously, but with a dawning hope
flushing through her tears. "I don't understand
howâ€”â€”" she began.</p>

<p>"You have been too near Guy," he remarked. "He
has never realised your value. At a little distance he
will be more clear-sighted. A woman is like any other
work of art. Her beauties are invisible unless seen in
proper perspective. While you live in the same house
he will never realise that you may be more than a sister."</p>

<p>"Then you thinkâ€”â€”" she asked.</p>

<p>"I am sure of it," replied Hora decisively. "It is to
give you the chance you desire that I have persuaded
Guy to live apart from us awhile, for that and in order
to discover something about a rival whom I suspect you
may have."

<small>CONCERNING A GREAT MAN'S VEXATION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>When the carriage containing the Great Man rolled
up to the door on the south side of Downing Street the
constable stationed there stiffened himself preparatory
to saluting. But his salute passed unnoticed. The door
swung open, but the commissionaire got not so much as
a glance.</p>

<p>"There's trouble brewing in China," said the worthy hall porter to
his circle of cronies that same evening in the private bar of the "Lord
Palmerston," "you mark my words if there isn't."</p>

<p>"More likely to be with Germany. That's the right
place to look for trouble," asserted one of the listeners.</p>

<p>"Of course, you would know better than me," replied
the worthy janitor. "You read the papers every day,
so you can't be wrong." There was unutterable scorn
in his tone as he referred to the press.</p>

<p>"And what's wrong with the papers?" enquired the
interlocutor in an aggrieved voice. "I suppose they
know as much about things as you do, any day."</p>

<p>The commissionaire pursed his lips, blew his nose,
and finished his beer before he found words to convey
his answer.</p>

<p>"The newspapers! The newspapers are common
liars!" he answered, "and ought to be hanged as such.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
Noâ€”don't you go for to speak up for 'emâ€”George Jenkinsâ€”we
know all about the papers in our department."</p>

<p>Jenkins did not subside immediately.</p>

<p>"I presume Sir Gadsby takes you into 'is confidenceâ€”not to say asks
your advice occasional?" he asked sarcastically.</p>

<p>"He might do worse than ask the advice of a man
who's fought in h'all four quarters of the globe and 'as
the right to wear six medals and twelve bars," interrupted
another listener propitiatingly.</p>

<p>"So he might," replied the commissionaire smiling genially, "but
that's neither here nor there. If you want to know why I say it's
China, I don't mind telling you." He glanced round to see that no
outsiders were within earshot and dropped his voice into a confidential
whisper.</p>

<p>"Four secretaries have I known since I went to our
place, and I studies 'em until I comes to read 'em like
books, and Sir Gadsby Dimbleby is one of the easiest
volumes I've ever had to study. I know 'is German
face an' 'is Russian face as well as I know my own.
This morning when he come in I could read China in 'is
heye as plain as if it were in the biggest print. You
mark my words there's trouble brewin' in China."</p>

<p>The oracle had spoken, and as is often the case with
oracles which have not been primed with facts, the utterance
was as wide of the mark as it could well be.</p>

<p>Sir Gadsby Dimbleby's brain had not been occupied in the least
degree with Chinese affairs as he passed the portals of the Foreign
Office. He was troubling about something which had happened much nearer
home, a subject which had been pigeonholed in one of the compartments
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
of his brain until the crisis in the relations with Germany caused by
the premature disclosure of the unfortunate incident in the South Seas
should have passed. That storm had been safely weathered, and H. M.
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs bethought himself of the promise
he had made to himself to discover how the information had leaked out.
To him it seemed uncommonly like treachery on the part of someone, and
being by birth, education, and natural instinct a thorough English
gentleman, the idea even of having to suspect anyone in the great
department of which he was the head of treachery was odious to him.
So the Great Man passed, heedless of the salutes of officials, to the
uttermost sanctum where the Permanent Secretary sat with his fingers
on the strings which directed British policy all over the world,
peacefully enjoying a matutinal cigar while glancing over the prÃ©cis of
a verbose despatch, prepared by his own secretary, from the Governor
of a wind-swept rock in the South Atlantic concerning the deadly
damage likely to be done to British interests by ceasing to imprison a
garrison in such an out-of-the-way spot.</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary looked up as the Great Man entered and
wondered. He was at a loss to understand the reason for the knitted
brow. The political horizon was clear and nothing could happen without
his knowledge. He guessed that the reason was domestic. He knew that
Lady Gadsby had a will of her own, and that even Great Men are human
enough to be annoyed by feminine displeasure.</p>

<p>But Sir Gadsby soon undeceived him. He fidgetted about uncomfortably
for a minute or two, irritably asking questions about minor matters
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
which had recently engaged his attention before he plunged into the subject
which filled his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Look here, Markham," he said, "that German business
in the South Pacific is still worrying me."</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary looked at him in surprise.
"There's no need to worry, Dimbleby," he answered,
"that storm's blown over all right."</p>

<p>"That's not the point," snapped Sir Gadsby. "What
I want to know is how that information leaked out in the
newspapers. Have you any suspicions?"</p>

<p>The Great Man frowned at the Permanent Secretary, and the Permanent
Secretary frowned at the Great Man. The Permanent Secretary was silent
so long that the Great Man continued, "I hate to think that any of our
people can have been so lost to all sense of decency and honour, yet
what on earth can I think? You have told me yourself that our despatch
must have been tapped somehow."</p>

<p>"I have puzzled over the matter as much as yourself," said the
Permanent Secretary slowly, "and am as much at a loss as yourself to
account for the information leaking out. It seems to me that there are
only two persons whom it is possible to suspect."</p>

<p>"And those?" queried the Great Man eagerly.</p>

<p>"Are our own two selves," was the answer.</p>

<p>Despite his irritation the Great Man laughed at the
whimsicality of the idea, but he became grave again
rapidly.</p>

<p>"If that's the case, we must bring a different order
of intelligence to bear upon the problem. What do you
say to asking the assistance of Scotland Yard, Markham?
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>"I've not much belief in Scotland Yard," replied the
Permanent Secretary, "but still there can be no harm
in our giving them the opportunity of investigating the
affair. They may discover a clue which will assist us
in coming to some conclusion."</p>

<p>"Then send over a messenger at once, Markham," said the Great Man
energetically. "I shall never feel safe if the contents of despatches
are to leak out in this manner. Ask the Commissioner to send over
his most intelligent officerâ€”no, ask them to send Kenly. I know he's
got common senseâ€”to make a delicate investigation. We will see him
together." Then he stalked off to his own room and worked off his
irritation in preparing sarcastic answers to inconvenient questions
in Parliament, of which notice had been given him by members of the
Opposition Party. Consequently he had recovered his accustomed urbanity
when the Permanent Secretary, accompanied by Detective Inspector Kenly,
was ushered into his presence. He greeted the newcomer heartily.</p>

<p>"Glad the Commissioner could spare you, Kenly. There's nothing
like having a man to undertake confidential work whom one knows from
experience one can trust. I suppose Sir Everard Markham has told you
what we want you to do?"</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary interrupted with a hasty
negation.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, the matter will not take long to explain,"
continued the Great Man. "Correct me if I am wrong,
Markham."</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary nodded and handed a cigar
case to the chief.</p>

<p>"Not before lunch," said the Great Man. He turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to the detective. "On the face of it the matter should prove a simple
one, Kenly, but just at present it is beyond our combined intelligence
to fathom it. Late on the fifteenthâ€”a Tuesday, wasn't it, Markham?â€”a
cypher cablegram containing important information came into this
office. The despatch was de-codedâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>"By myself," interrupted the Permanent Secretary.</p>

<p>"Placed in a despatch case which was sealed in the
usual way and forwarded by King's Messenger to me,"
continued Sir Gadsby. "I received the case, broke the
seals myself, and retained the despatch in my own possession."</p>

<p>"Yes," said the detective, as the Great Man paused.</p>

<p>"The despatch related to the recent trouble in the South Pacific,
the German affair," remarked the Permanent Secretary, "and next morning
there was wild excitement on the Stock Exchange, and later in the day
the newspapers published full details of the trouble, much to our
embarrassment."</p>

<p>"Hâ€”m," said the detective, "I suppose you want me
to find out who gave the show away?"</p>

<p>"Your perspicacity is wonderful, Kenly," remarked the Great Man
drily and the Permanent Secretary smiled. "At present, Markham, I know,
suspects me of 'giving the show away,' as you put it, and if I didn't
know Markham I should be compelled to suspect him. We are really the
only two possible suspects."</p>

<p>"Hâ€”m," said the detective a second time before remarking
deprecatingly, "The despatch passed through the hands of a third
person. I think you mentioned a King's Messenger?"</p>

<p>"I sealed the despatches with my own hands," remarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
the Permanent Secretary. "And the seals were
intact when I took the case from Captain Marven's
hands," added the Great Man.</p>

<p>The detective hazarded another suggestion.</p>

<p>"Is it quite impossible that the information might
not have reached the Stock Exchange and the newspapers
from an external source?"</p>

<p>"So far as we can ascertain, quite impossible," replied
the Permanent Secretary. "We have ascertained that
no cable was received in London which could in any way
have related to the affair before the publication of the
news."</p>

<p>"It seems to me," said the Great Man briskly, "that
even if we cannot get direct evidence as to the source
through which the information leaked out, we should at
least be able to come to some sort of conclusion if we
knew the names of the parties who must have benefited
by the Stock Exchange operations."</p>

<p>"I see," said the detective. "Well, Sir Gadsby, I'll
do my best to find that out for you."</p>

<p>"I know you will, Kenly," said the Great Man. "But not a word to
anyone; and, while I think of it, I'll write a note to the Commissioner
and ask him to allow you to report directly to Markham here, and to
devote your whole time and attention to this business."</p>

<p>"Very good, Sir Gadsby," said the detective, and the
interview ended.</p>

<p>When alone with the Permanent Secretary, Inspector Kenly asked every
question which occurred to his active brain, but he elucidated nothing
more than the very simple facts with which he had already been made
acquainted, and when he left the Foreign Office it was with no very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
hopeful feeling of being able to lay his hand on the culprit. It is
true that there had occurred to him the glimmering of a possibility as
to who might have been responsible for the disclosure. The despatches
had been in the possession of a third party, in the possession of
Captain Marven, the King's Messenger, for seven or eight hours; and
Inspector Kenly had no particular reason for believing that official
locks and seals were more inviolable than any other locks and seals
if submitted to the gentle manipulation of an expert. But he had met
Captain Marven in the course of his official life, and what he had seen
of him led him to credit the reputation for perfect probity and honour
which the King's Messenger held in the eyes of the world.</p>

<p>"I should have liked an easier job," grumbled Inspector Kenly to
himself. "Another failure to find out anything coming on top of my
failure to get the slightest clue to the mystery of the Flurscheim
affair will make the Chief think that I am getting past my work.
However, it's no use worrying because I'm not possessed of the gift of
divination. What is, was to be," with which philosophic reflection he
stepped aboard a 'bus bound Citywards, and, while engaged there in his
investigations, the Great Man, having finished preparing his list of
answers for the day's sitting of Parliament, carried off the Permanent
Secretary to lunch with him. They enjoyed their meal none the less
because they had unloaded the cause of their vexation upon the broad
shoulders of Detective Inspector Kenly.

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br>
<small>A NEW VIEW OF THE FLURSCHEIM ROBBERY</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Time did not touch Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim's sore with a healing
finger. A month after he had been robbed of his treasures the wound
was still open, though by that time he had been wise enough to conceal
it with a decent bandage from the curious eyes of the public. But
his friends and his enemies knew that it was there and condoled or
rejoiced, according to their several temperaments. Perhaps there were
more who rejoiced than of those who pitied him, for Flurscheim was not
a popular man. Even his friends were compelled to admit that he was
something of a curmudgeon, and were not quite so sorry as they would
have been had the loss fallen upon anyone else.</p>

<p>After the robbery he became more curmudgeonish than ever, and his
perpetual growlings at everything and everybody made him so undesirable
a companion that even his poor relations began to find that his company
was an infliction that was barely endurable, even when sweetened by
the prospect of figuring in his will. Yet as people shrank from him
he seemed anxious for society. Partly because he realised that if he
were cloistered with his own thoughts his broodings would terminate in
madness, and partly because he wished to make clear to the world that
his loss was a mere triviality to a man of his wealth, he sought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
entertain in a manner which was entirely foreign to his earlier habit
and his real desire. He had a wide acquaintance, and there were many
of the butterflies of fashion and rank who were attracted to his
dinner-table once by curiosity. If, after the experience, they decided
not to go a second time, it was too early for the connoisseur to have
discovered the fact. It was in pursuance of this campaign of detraction
that he had found himself at the opera when his stares had proved so
discomposing to Meriel Challys andâ€”afterwardsâ€”to Guy. The latter, had
he known, need have taken no alarm. Flurscheim's scrutiny was not
directed towards him. Meriel's face alone had engaged his attention.
He had first caught sight of her as she had bent forward to drink in
the music, and he recognised that her features were familiar to him,
but where and when he had met her he could not for the moment remember.
It was not until after he had left the opera house that his memory
supplied the answer he sought. Then he remembered that one of the
stolen miniatures would have served as a portrait of the girl.</p>

<p>Immediately he began to weave a new theory concerning the burglary.
He had woven many theories before; avarice, spite, disappointed rivalry
had all supplied motives for them, but never had he considered the
possibility of a love motive for the robbery. Supposing that some
unfavoured suitor had seen the miniature, and, coveting it, had broken
in to steal it. No! Such a theory was too wild for even his own belief.
Yet the likeness was so extraordinary that he looked forward to meeting
the owner of the strangely attractive face again.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured him, for within a week he found
himself at a garden party at which Meriel was also a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
guest. He sought and obtained an introduction from the
hostess, and was quite oblivious to the chilly character
of his reception.</p>

<p>"I particularly wanted to meet you, Miss Challys. Indeed, I may
say that since I saw you at the opera a week ago your face has really
haunted me," said Flurscheim.</p>

<p>Meriel's eyebrows arched. She meditated flight.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you must have thought me an awful bounder, staring at
you the other night," he continued, "but your face was so familiar to
me, and yet I could not recall where I had met you. It wasn't until
after the opera was over that I remembered that one of my stolen
miniatures was a most striking portrait of you; I hope that you will
realise that my rudeness was unintentional."</p>

<p>"I certainly did not think so at the time," replied
Meriel.</p>

<p>"It was quite a relief when I placed my memory,"
said the connoisseur. "D'you know that I'm one of
those men that are made supremely uncomfortable by a
lapse of memory of that sort. I begin to think my brain's
failing if it doesn't respond at once to any call I make
upon it, and after my recent worry I really began to be
anxious."</p>

<p>"Did the burglary worry you so much as all that?"
replied Meriel. Usually sympathetic to any story of
trouble, she felt it difficult to express any sympathy with
the loss the wealthy connoisseur had sustained.</p>

<p>"Worry me?" asked Flurscheim in an astonished
tone. "Worry me?" he repeated. "Worry isn't the
name for what I've gone through. I can see you don't
understand what a collector's treasures mean to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
My dear young lady"â€”in his excitement an accent became
audible which made of the words "ma tear young
lady,"â€”"my pictures are what I've lived for. If I lose
them my life is as emptyâ€”as empty"â€”he looked round
for an appropriate simile and found one handyâ€”"as
most of these people's pockets."</p>

<p>Meriel smiled at the racial revelation. Flurscheim thought she
smiled at the simile itself. "Fortunately it was only one of my
pictures that was taken," he continued, "but"â€”he could not resist the
wailâ€”"it was the best of the lot. I would rather have lost any two of
the others."</p>

<p>Meriel began to be interested in the man. He was
manifestly honest in his confession. She even managed
to infuse a little sympathy into her enquiry as to whether
the police had obtained no clue to the thief. By so asking
she struck another chord in the keyboard of the Flurscheim
emotions.</p>

<p>"The police! Fools! Dolts! Idiots!" he exclaimed.
"Of what use are the police but to strut about and
direct the traffic? When it comes to catching thieves
they are just about as useful as the pigeons in the
parks. Some of them call themselves detectives," he
continued with virulent scorn. "There's one of them
called Kenly, an inspector with a reputation of being
one of the smartest men at Scotland Yard! Got it, I
should think, the same way as an owl gets a reputation
for wisdom. Cocks his ears, opens his eyes wide, and
keeps his mouth shut. For nearly six weeks he has been
doing nothing else but investigate my robbery. And
what has he found out? Nothing, absolutely nothing.
Detectives, bah!" He pulled himself up with an effort.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
"I've promised myself I wouldn't talk about the matter
to anyone, Miss Challys. I can't do so without losing
my temper, and it will give you a very bad opinion of me
if I have to apologise to you twice in one day."</p>

<p>"You seem to lose it pretty easily, Mr. Flurscheim,"
she answered.</p>

<p>"Can't help it, Miss Challys. So I'll apologise straight away for
doing so and for staring at you the other night, for I know you were
annoyed. It never struck me that you might be annoyed, you know. Most
girls to-day take it as a compliment when a man looks 'em over."</p>

<p>Meriel stiffened and, looking away, met Guy's eyes.
She had known that he expected to be present, and at
the recognition her whole face brightened. Guy had
already recognised Flurscheim, and though the fact that
he was apparently engaged in earnest conversation with
Meriel gave him a twinge of apprehension, he did not
hesitate to come forward.</p>

<p>Flurscheim looked upon the young man disapprovingly as Meriel put
her hand in his. He saw that his existence was momentarily obliterated
from the girl's mind. But he did not move from her side, and when,
still forgetful, she strolled away with Guy across the lawn without
even turning her head in his direction, he muttered a curse in which
Guy was included amongst things in general, but from which Meriel
herself was just as certainly excluded.</p>

<p>No sooner were they out of hearing than Guy gave
expression to the curiosity which the sight of Flurscheim
in conversation with Meriel had excited in him.</p>

<p>"However did that bounder Flurscheim manage to
corner you, Miss Challys?" he asked.</p>

<p>Meriel glanced round. "Oh! I had quite forgotten
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
him," she said laughing, "although I was wondering
how I should manage to escape him when I saw you."</p>

<p>"After staring at you the other night in so impertinent
a manner I wonder he had the cheek to face you," continued
Guy irritably.</p>

<p>"Oh! he explained all that," replied Meriel. "He
sought me out to-day in order to apologise." She told
how the connoisseur had been puzzled to account for his
familiarity with her face and his ultimate recognition of
her as the autotype of one of his missing miniatures.</p>

<p>Guy smiled at the explanation. He realised with an exceptional
degree of pleasure that the miniature was now in his own possession.
He had long ago carefully removed the picture from the lid of the
snuff-box in which it had been set and had reset it himself in a
simple gold frame with a circlet of brilliants. It was his by right of
possession, and he determined that it should remain his. Incidentally
the information Meriel had given him that she had been the object of
Flurscheim's scrutiny came as a relief. It was proof that he himself
was in no way suspected. At the same time it seemed to Guy an added
impertinence on the part of the connoisseur that he should have sought
to make Meriel's acquaintance. It gave him pleasure to think that he
had despoiled the Jew of his treasures. He would have liked to have
confided his thoughts to the girl at his side. He was almost on the
point of doing so when his common sense bade him pause. She would not
understand. She was not tutored in the doctrine of the rights of the
individual to possess everything upon which he may lay his hand. But he
could not resist the opportunity which seemed to offer to open her eyes
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
to some of his own beliefs. If he presented them delicately they might
not offend. Crudely expressed, he knew that she would not listen.</p>

<p>"Flurscheim is hardly the sort of person who deserves
to possess beautiful things," he hazarded.</p>

<p>"There seems something incongruous in the idea," she
said smiling her reply. "But there can be no doubt but
that he has a very real love for them."</p>

<p>"Can't believe it," said Guy emphatically. "The capacity to acquire
beautiful things and the capacity to see their beauties rarely go
together."</p>

<p>"I should think that your argument would rather apply
to the burglar who stole Mr. Flurscheim's valuables
than to Mr. Flurscheim," replied Meriel merrily.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily," answered Guy. "It might be that the person in
whose possession they are now is far more capable of appreciating the
Greuze or of the miniature which he declares is so like yourself, than
he is, and if such should happen to be the case hasn't the present
possessor as much right as Flurscheim to the enjoyment of them?"</p>

<p>He spoke lightly and Meriel replied in the same tone.</p>

<p>"Isn't that an argument which might apply to anything
of the nature of personal possessions?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Certainly," he responded quickly. "Is the man or woman, who wants
a thing, to go without it when somebody else has more of the same
article than he knows what to do with? Look at that fat old woman over
there"â€”the disrespectful allusion referred to the maternal relative
of the latest American addition by marriage to the list of British
peeressesâ€”"she's so loaded up with jewels that she absolutely clanks as
she walks. She has enough on her to satisfy the aspirations of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
hundred ordinary women. Why should she have all those pretty stones and
trinkets and lots of other women go without?"</p>

<p>"She certainly is wearing far too much jewellery for
a garden party," replied Meriel, her eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>"Yet if any other woman were to relieve her of even the smallest of
her extraneous adornments the mere possession of which would probably
give her far more pleasure than it does to the present possessor,
there's not a man or woman here who would not cry 'to gaol with the
thief,'" said Guy.</p>

<p>Despite his intention, Guy had warmed to the argument,
and he awoke a corresponding earnestness in his
companion.</p>

<p>"I don't think I should," she said quietly. "I should
pity her too much."</p>

<p>"But why?" he asked. "She would merely have
shown herself to have the courage of her desires."</p>

<p>Meriel shook her head. "I always pity people who
cannot control their desires, particularly when those desires
are for things that don't belong to them."</p>

<p>"But," urged Guy, "everyone is born with the right
to enjoy. That fat old woman has long ago ceased to
find enjoyment in many of her trinkets. Why pity anyone
who would at one stroke relieve her of her burden
and at the same time provide themselves with a new
pleasure?"</p>

<p>Meriel knitted her brows. "I'm no good at an ethical
argument, Mr. Hora," she said. "And I am quite sure
you only want to get me to agree with you so that you
may laugh at me afterwards."</p>

<p>"No," he answered. "I've no <i>arriÃ¨re pensÃ©e</i> of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
sort you imagine. I know you would think it wrong,
the majority think it wrong for anyone to help themselves
to other people's things. I want to know why."</p>

<p>Meriel looked at him archly. "Suppose I were to
slip behind that comfortable old lady and snip off that
little watch all studded with diamonds from her chatelaine,
what would you think of me?"</p>

<p>"I wish to Heaven you would," he answered.</p>

<p>Meriel laughed. "I should never have thought that
you could be so strongly provoked by mere ostentation."</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of the old woman," he answered.
"My admiration would be entirely attributable to your
pluck in defying the conventions."</p>

<p>"But afterwards?" she objected. "You could never
have the slightest respect for me."</p>

<p>"On the contraryâ€”â€”" he began.</p>

<p>She interrupted him. "No," she said. "You would
no more respect me than I could you, if, for instance,
you had stolen poor Mr. Flurscheim's picture."</p>

<p>He was taken aback by the apposite allusion. For a second, and for
a second only, he imagined that there was intention in her selection
of the simile. But a glance into the smiling eyes which met his so
frankly disabused his mind of the idea. Clearly, the girl never thought
that he could possibly have engaged in such an adventure. She had not
the slightest idea that he was guiltyâ€”no, that was the wrong word, the
coward's word, no guilt attached to his actionsâ€”that he was capable of
such a feat. She saw that he was disturbed and continued gaily.</p>

<p>"Why, even the supposition of such a thing is repugnant
to you, and yet you ask why?"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>"Even suppose that the idea is repugnant," he replied,
"I still ask why it is so. Reason could justify the action."</p>

<p>"For reason say sophistry," she answered quickly.
"You know that the repugnance of the thought is inbred.
It's inherited. We can't help thinking like that
because the knowledge of right and wrong is intuitive."</p>

<p>"A woman's answer," he answered lightly.</p>

<p>"A man's still more," she said with earnestness. "One might possibly
forgive a woman's theft. We are the weaker creatures and the more
easily swayed by our desires. But the man should be strong enough to
resist. No man worthy the name could stoop to dishonour himself in so
petty a manner, nor could he have aught but contempt for the woman who
so gave way to her covetousness. No, Mr. Hora. You could never persuade
me that you could have an atom of respect for me if I were to so forget
my principles as to filch any one of the over-jewelled dowager's
trinkets? Now, would you?"</p>

<p>He sought refuge from the direct answer in a side issue. "But if
your principles were such that you honestly believed that the good lady
had no more right than yourself to her jewels and that only the fear of
punishment restrained you from taking possession of them?"</p>

<p>Meriel laughed gaily. "I cannot even conceive such
a possibility," she said. "It seems to me you are
preaching anarchy, and I'm not the least little bit of an
anarchist."</p>

<p>The approach of a third person interrupted Guy's reply.
Looking away from Meriel he saw Captain Marven
standing beside him. The Captain had heard his
niece's concluding words and he corroborated them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span></p>

<p>"I can safely swear that a more tyrannical dictator of
law and order than Meriel never stepped over a man's
threshold. You must accuse her of something else,
Hora."</p>

<p>Guy laughed and the subject dropped. But the conversation had made
an impression upon him. It had destroyed, though at the time he did not
recognise the fact, the delight he had felt in being something apart
from other men, the exhilaration of being in conflict with the world.
The obvious scorn which the girl felt for the thief, her absolute
belief that the idea of theft was as repugnant to him as it was to
herself, were deadly blows to the philosophy which Lynton Hora fondly
imagined he had planted so deeply as to be ineradicable. Guy felt that
his belief was crumbling. He knew that if he were to be true to the
man he knew as father he should forswear the bewitching companionship
of the girl who exercised so unsettling an influence upon him,
nevertheless when a little later Captain Marven asked him to visit them
at their country home when the season was over, he accepted eagerly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br>
<small>GUY FINDS A NEW HOME</small>
</h2></div>

<p>In the days that followed the conversation between Guy and Meriel,
the young man's disquiet strengthened, though he hid his perturbation
successfully enough from the eyes of his daily companions. He met the
Marvens frequently, for he could not resist the fascination Meriel
exercised upon him. He could see that he was a welcome visitor at the
Marvens' house, and yet every time he accepted their hospitality he
felt a twinge of regret that Captain Marven should have been a victim
of his predatory philosophy, even though the victim had not been
personally injured thereby. Instinctively he loathed himself for the
treacherous part he appeared to be playing, even though he argued that
he had but played a man's part in avenging his father's wrongs.</p>

<p>He would have felt more satisfied if he could have been made
acquainted with the nature of those wrongs. But when he had ventured a
question on the subject Lynton Hora's brow had wrinkled into a heavy
frown, and he had harshly bidden Guy to refer no more to the subject.
Nor could he gain the least enlightenment from Meriel, though he
had discreetly questioned her regarding her uncle's early life. No
suspicion as to his real parentage ever crossed his mind. Meriel had
merely referred to the great grief of her relatives' lives in terms
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
which had produced in Guy's mind the idea that their only child had
died in infancy. "Poor auntie and uncle lost their only child when he
was three years old," she had said, "and even now no one ever dares
mention his name in their presence, they feel the loss so acutely. His
name was Guy, like yours, and I think that is partly why they seem to
like you so much."</p>

<p>From his acquaintance with Captain Marven, Guy could not conceive
that the kindly hearted man had ever done anyone a deliberate injury.
He began to question the possibility of Hora being possessed of
some delusion on the subject and longed the more to be acquainted
with the facts in order that he might be in a position to put the
misunderstanding right. Since that was hopeless, however, he was
profoundly thankful that Hora had insisted upon his taking a residence
apart. He had found chambers which suited him in the "Albany," and
there he was free to brood over his own mental problems without the
possibility of having to meet Lynton Hora's enquiring glance. He no
longer felt satisfied with his tutor's philosophy. He was almost afraid
to lay bare his new-born doubts to the scorn which the Commandatore
would pour upon his heart-searchings. He imagined that the Commandatore
had no idea that any conflict was taking place in his mind. He
flattered himself that he had long since obtained complete mastery
over the expression of his thoughts, that his face was no dial of his
emotions but a mask for their concealment. But he did less than justice
to his master's perceptive powers. He was not conscious that it needed
an effort to remain in the company of the Commandatore, but Lynton Hora
perceived it, and realising that Guy was concealing something from him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
determined to become acquainted with the details of the matter
concealed. He had not lost confidence in Guy. He did not imagine that
the truth of principles he had so carefully instilled was likely to be
questioned. But Captain Marven was so associated with the black days,
marked indelibly in his life's calendar, that he could not feel easy
in his mind now that he had once more crossed his path. Besides, for
the consummation of the revenge he was planning, it was imperative
that no nook or corner of Guy's life should be veiled from his sight.
That was the real reason why he had suggested Guy's finding an abode
for himself. He desired to be made acquainted with Guy's movements,
the houses he visited and the companions he affected when away from
home. It would have been difficult to set such a watch on Guy, if he
had remained at the flat in Westminster, without subjecting himself to
inconvenience; but installed in chambers of his own, it would be easy
to obtain information.</p>

<p>Hora's first intention had been to keep watch himself on Guy's
movements, but consideration decided him to employ some tool for the
purpose. His thoughts had lingered for a moment on Myra, but that
suggestion also was speedily put aside; she was too passionately
interested in Guy to prove a trustworthy spy upon his actions. Hora
knew where to look for a reliable tool, for, secretive though he was,
averse to allowing any outsider to co-operate with him in the execution
of any of his enterprises, yet he had kept in touch with certain of
the companions who had worked beside him, groaned under the same
harsh discipline, in the days of his expiation. None of them knew him
by name. But his face was known to them, and welcomed, for he never
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
appeared amongst them without bringing largesse for their debauches,
and, more welcome still, suggestions of places where booty awaited the
skilful craftsman with bold heart, and wise words of advice as to the
means by which it might be acquired. These denizens of the lower world
guessed that their unknown benefactor was of themselves, though moving
on a higher plane. The suggestions he made were invariably audacious,
but when put into practice they almost as invariably proved successful,
so that the unknown became known amongst them as the Master.</p>

<p>Guy had not been settled in his new abode for more than three
days when Hora set out in search of someone who would undertake
the business. He took all his usual precautions in order to avoid
identification, though he relied more upon the assumption of a new
character than upon any physical disguise. He entered a train which
carried him away to London's most beautiful possession, the Royal
Gardens of Kew. He entered the gates a bright, alert personality. He
had an appreciative eye for the beauties of the trees and the flowers,
but he did not linger amongst them, seeking a retired spot amongst the
trees in the wild portion of the demesne. When half an hour later he
retraced his steps nothing but the curious limp in his gait would have
hinted at his identity. The overcoat which he had carried on his arm
was now worn on his back. Its threadbare seams and worn cuffs were an
eloquent testimony of poverty. The sprucely folded umbrella had become
baggy, and instead of carrying it on his arm he leaned heavily upon it.
A pair of steel spectacles were fixed upon his nose. His hat had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
exchanged for another much the worse for wear. His collar had been
replaced by one of clerical cut. A Bible, much worn, was under his arm.
He looked like a mild, inoffensive clergyman who had fallen upon evil
days, or a curate who had never fallen upon good ones, and anyone who
spared him a single glance would have been ready to stake a good round
sum that the contents of the bag he carried consisted mainly of tracts.
Returning to the railway station he asked in the mildest of voices for
a ticket to Latimer Road, and bungled over counting the change while
the people waiting behind him impatiently snorted at his clumsiness.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I beg your pardon for detaining you," he
said when the coppers were safely put away in a shabby
old purse. He was always authentic in his impersonations.</p>

<p>No one took the slightest heed of him when he reached the station
to which he had booked, and, alighting, set his face in the direction
of Notting Dale. He walked steadily on, turning now to the left now
to the right again. Each street he entered seemed to worsen in some
indefinable manner. The main road into which he had passed from the
station had been merely one of London's characterless thoroughfares,
with rows of struggling shops, each flaunting the banner of cheapness
in the face of passers-by. A sign of a poor neighbourhood this, and off
the main road the signs were more pronounced. The open doors, the women
sitting at open windows, the babies on the stairs and the pavements,
the voice of the coal hawker, were all unmistakable signs. Presently
the dress of the women became more blowsy, the children dirtier, men
were to be seen lolling from the windows and gathered in groups outside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the doors of the public houses; when policemen were to be seen at all,
they were in couples. Hora's face wore an air of positive benevolence.
A boy of five or six years ran beside him with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"Spare us a copper, guvnor?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hora paused. "I have no coppers to spare, my child,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"I ain't had no breakfus," said the child.</p>

<p>Hora's eyes twinkled.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are not speaking the truth, my boy," he remarked
blandly. "Still"â€”he opened his bag carefully and extracted therefrom a
packet of sticky sweets and a bundle of tracts. "I don't expect you get
many sweeties. Hold out your hand."</p>

<p>The youngster did as he was bidden. Hora counted
four sugary lumps into the eager palm. "Never tell a
lie, my boy," he said solemnly.</p>

<p>The child seemed unimpressed. "I say, is that all,
guvnor?" he asked as Hora replaced the paper of sweets
in his bag.</p>

<p>The incident had not passed unobserved. From a
doorway close at hand a bullet-headed man, whose
cranial outline was the more strongly marked because
of the closely cropped hair, was looking on with a grin
on his countenance, while across the road a couple of
policemen were also watching. The bullet-headed person
spoke suddenly.</p>

<p>"You run away and stop worriting the good gen'l'man,"
he said.</p>

<p>The boy looked up, caught sight of the policemen,
and whirling on his heels disappeared like a rabbit into
its burrow.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>"The very kids in this street learn to tell the tale afore
they can walk," remarked the round-head pleasantly.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's a very wicked street," said Hora with
a sigh. "The devil has many disciples in Fancy Lane."</p>

<p>"Guess you're right there, guvnor," replied the man.
"There's two on 'em comin' across the road to talk to
you now." There was a shadow of a wink in his eye.</p>

<p>"Let me hope you will have nothing to do with them,"
said Hora earnestly, "any more than I should myself.
You must know where companionship of that sort leads."</p>

<p>"I know that right enough," said the man passing his
hand over his closely cropped hair. "I don't have no
more truck with that sort than I can help."</p>

<p>Hora reopened his bag and took from it a tract.</p>

<p>"You may find some helpful words here," he said.
"This little story is called 'The Downward Path.' Take
it and it may prove a blessing to you."</p>

<p>He turned away, and, for the first time, appeared to
become aware of the presence of the two policemen.</p>

<p>"I am afraid that I did not rightly apprehend that
good man's meaning," he said aloud as if talking to himself.</p>

<p>One of the policemen looked down upon the bent
figure.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir," he said, "I just wanted to make
sure it was you, because this street, as you know, isn't too
safe for strangers."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my friend," replied Hora. "But you
know that I am as safe here as at my own home." The
policemen passed on.</p>

<p>"There won't come no harm to him," said the elder to
his companion. "They knows he's a harmless old crank,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
an' they chy-ikes him a bit for comin' to convert 'em
with a packet of tracts for the men and a packet of
sweets for the kids, but he's safe enough, for he never
has anything about him to make it worth while anyone
knocking him on the head."</p>

<p>"He comes pretty reg'lar, I suppose then?" asked the
second constable. "I've not seen him before."</p>

<p>"Three or four times a year, may be. There's plenty
knows him in the street."</p>

<p>They passed out of sight and Hora went on his way, stopping now and
then to speak to a man or a woman or to bestow a sweet on some urchin
in the gutter. So, progressing slowly, he reached an archway which
had once formed an entrance to a builder's yard. He passed beneath it
and crossed the open space to a shed which stood at the far end. The
ground was littered with rubbish of all sorts, dirty wisps of straw,
dirty pieces of newspaper, rotting cabbage stalks and decomposing
remains of fish. Reaching the shed he gave no knock but pushed the
door open and entered. Outside, the July sun was shining brightly and
within the darkness was so dense that he stood still until his eyes
grew accustomed to it. The shed was provided with one small window, but
three of its four panes were glazed with brown paper and the remaining
pane of glass was so begrimed that only a feeble light forced entrance
through it.</p>

<p>While he stood in the doorway striving to penetrate
the gloom a human voice, though it was so far unlike
the ordinary human voice that it might have belonged to
any creature but one made in God's image, began to
mutter and gurgle in the darkest corner.</p>

<p>"Ma Norton?" asked Hora.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>The answer came like a wheeze of a dropsical spider.</p>

<p>"Get out of this. I don't want no ant'em cacklers
round my place."</p>

<p>By this time Hora's vision had grown accustomed to the
semi-darkness. He took off his hat and laid it on the table. He saw
that but for one old woman seated in a corner there was no one else
present. "Your eyesight's failing, Ma," he remarked composedly. The old
woman struggled to her feet. "Blimy! If it ain't the Master hisself,"
she wheezed. "What's brought you down here again so soon?"</p>

<p>"What else should but the desire to see you a reformed character,
the desire to read the Bible to you, pray with you with the object
of ending your days in the workhouse like a decent Christian woman.
Haâ€”haâ€”ha!" He laughed at his own ribaldry.</p>

<p>"He! He! He!" the old woman cackled in response. Her pallid,
pendulous, flabby cheeks flapped as she shook with merriment. Her
enormous frame, held loosely together about the waist and shoulders
with untidy tapes, threatened to collapse like a half-cooled jelly
shaken too soon from the mould. The tears started from her eyes and
ran down her cheeks. She gasped and choked until reaching for a bottle
standing handily on a shelf she poured something from it into a tumbler
standing by and tossed off the draught.</p>

<p>"That's better," she remarked. "You shouldn't make
me laugh, Master. Laughing shakes me so that I'm
afraid it'll be the death of me some day."</p>

<p>"No fear," answered Hora. "You will finish yourself
off with the gin bottle first."</p>

<p>"Lord! What a man it is for making game of an old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
woman's little weakness," she replied composedly. "But
what's brought you here to-day out of your time? Nothin's
happened to my gal, has there?"</p>

<p>"Getting anxious to have her home again?" remarked
Hora sardonically. "I'm not sure that she would appreciate
the home you could give her."</p>

<p>He looked round him and smiled at the thought of Myra transported
into such surroundings. The bare walls of the shed with the plaster
broken and crumbling away; the filthy floor with a grimy sack thrown
before the fenderless fireplace to do service as rug; the two stained
deal tables littered with old articles of crockery, remnants of food,
articles of attire, all mixed up together; the broken chairs; the
grubby bed and bedding in the corner, would make a strange setting for
the exotic beauty who at that very moment would probably be stepping
from her perfumed bath to don a dainty dressing gown before submitting
to the ministrations of her maid.</p>

<p>The old woman watched his glance distrustfully.
"You ain't thinking of turning her out, Master?" she
whined. "I know very well she's well off where she
is, an' you know this ain't no place for the likes of
her."</p>

<p>"I might bring her here to see you one day. I'm sure
she would be glad to see her mother," he remarked.</p>

<p>The woman rose again from the chair. She spoke with
ill-concealed agitation.</p>

<p>"Don't you go for to do it, Master. Don't you do it.
I'm quite satisfied so long as I knows she's all right.
There ain't no call for her to set eyes on the likes of me.
Why, it might happen that she would sick at the sight."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
Her voice died away and she repeated dully, "Don't you
go for to do it!"</p>

<p>"I don't think she would be exactly pleased," remarked
Hora. "But make you mind easy, Ma. It's
nothing to do with Myra that I want to see you about.
You hear a lot of things in this part of the world, and
I wondered whether by any chance you have heard
lately of Corny Jessel. I have a job for him."</p>

<p>The old woman reseated herself and helped herself
thoughtfully to another allowance of gin. "When did
I last hear tell of him?" she murmured. "Not so long
ago, for certain. The shadder-man, you mean, ain't it,
Master? Corny Jessel, the shadder-man?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hora. "The shadow-man."</p>

<p>"My memory ain't what it was," said the old woman
disconsolately, "but I'm sure I heard about him only the
other day."</p>

<p>Hora lit a cigarette and smoked calmly while the
woman racked her memory. At last he was rewarded
for his patience.</p>

<p>"It was Bully Hagan telled me he'd seen him only the
other day."</p>

<p>"The round-headed man who's just come out of
prison?" asked Hora.</p>

<p>"Lives at 27 in the Street, first floor front," said the
woman.</p>

<p>"I met him on my way here," said Hora. "I'll go
and find him." He rose to go.</p>

<p>"You haven't told me how my gal's lookin'," said the
woman.</p>

<p>Hora laughed, but he good naturedly complied with the request, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
for five minutes poured into the greedy ears of the woman a description
of the dresses and the jewels her daughter wore at the theatres and
dinners and dances to which she had recently been. Then he took his
departure, leaving behind him a couple of gold pieces in the old
woman's palm. In the street he resumed his missionary demeanour and
passing along from house to house found Bully Hagan at the same spot
where he had parted from him, and in exchange for another piece of gold
was soon put in possession of the address he sought. He wrote it down
on a piece of paper.</p>

<p>Cornelius Jessel, Woodbine Cottage, Melpomene Road,
Wimbledon.</p>

<p>And, resuming his progress, came at last to the more
respectable streets and finally to the railway station again.

<small>INSPECTOR KENLY'S LODGER</small>
</h2></div>

<p>One day at the beginning of July Detective Inspector Kenly's face
as he left the railway station and stepped out briskly homewards wore
a particularly injured air. It was not entirely owing to the sultry
state of the atmosphere, though that may have had something to do with
his frame of mind. He considered himself to be a greatly aggrieved man.
In the first place his investigations into the Flurscheim burglary had
been an abject and total failure. He had spent day and night following
up illusory clues without the slightest result. On top of this he had
been entrusted with the investigation of the stolen despatch affair,
and after three days' laborious enquiry found himself no nearer any
accurate result than he had been when he commenced, save that certain
names on the list of members of the Stock Exchange had been ticked off
as unable to afford any information. These failures he might have borne
with equanimity had they been his sole grievance. But he had another,
and being a purely personal, private, domestic grievance, it rankled
far more than any of the others.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Kenly was a married man, and when Mrs. Detective
Inspector determined to have her own way, Mr. Detective Inspector,
however clever he was at circumventing the wiliest of criminals,
invariably succumbed to the wiles of the smiling lady who ruled over
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
his household. Happily any difference between them was rare, but there
was one subject upon which they never could agree. The Inspector liked
to keep his home to himself. He thought that his good lady had quite
enough to do to look after himself and the two little Kenlys. But that
was not Mrs. Kenly's opinion at all. She thought that no home was
complete without a lodger. To her such a thing as a spare bedroom in
her house was an abomination. She looked upon it as so much capital
lying idle, instead of being put out at interest with some eligible
young man or young woman. When he had taken Woodbine Cottage, Melpomene
Road, Wimbledon, Kenly had thought that he should have circumvented
Mrs. Kenly's little idiosyncrasy. But there were two attics in the
cottage which had not entered into his calculations. It did not occur
to him that they could be utilised for any other purpose than as
box-rooms. But Mrs. Kenly thought differently. In her eyes they would
make quite adequate, if small, bedrooms, so before he had been settled
in the house for a month, all the Inspector's arrangements were recast,
the youthful Kenlys were relegated to the attics, while the largest
bedroom on the first floor was furnished as a bed sitting-room and a
card placed in the window announced to all and sundry that "furnished
apartments" were to be secured at Woodbine Cottage.</p>

<p>The card did not remain there very long. Woodbine
Cottage looked so spick and span; the bright windows,
the white curtains, the spotless doorstep, and shining
brass knocker were such attractive testimonials to the
quality of the accommodation to be found within, that
the eligible lodger was speedily secured. For six years
Inspector Kenly entertained a single lady of mature years
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
and a small income. He did not repine overmuch, for
she had few friends, gave little trouble, and was more or
less of a companion to Mrs. Kenly when his business, as
it often did, took him away from home.</p>

<p>But, when she left, Inspector Kenly made another effort
to persuade his wife to do without "the lodger."
In vain he argued that his income was ample for the
wants of the household. Mrs. Kenly would not listen.
Once again the card appeared in the window, and in due
course Cornelius Jessel, passing by, saw it there, and,
being at the time in want of a quiet retreat in a really
respectable neighbourhood, thought that the apartments,
if not too expensive, would suit him. He saw the bed
sitting-room. He liked its appearance so well that he
paid a week's rent there and then in advance, and thus,
when Inspector Kenly returned home one evening, he
found that he was once more possessed of a lodger.</p>

<p>Possibly, if Cornelius Jessel had been acquainted with the position
and occupation of the head of the household into which he had entered,
he might not have been so ready to take possession of the comfortable
bed sitting-room. But Inspector Kenly did not think it desirable to
blazon abroad his connection with Scotland Yard. He had particularly
insisted upon any lodger who entered his house remaining unacquainted
with his profession. So Cornelius Jessel had not the slightest idea
that he was living under the roof of one of the men whom he had long
ago learned to look upon as an enemy. Indeed, he had real reasons to
fear the emissaries of law and order. Not that he was by any means a
person of importance in the criminal world. He was merely one of those
backboneless creatures who have the will but lack the courage to do
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
any daring deed which would make them famous in the annals of crime;
one of those poor shrinking, cringing creatures who are content to
play the part of jackal to more venturesome spirits, a petty thief
sometimes, an astute writer of begging letters at others, a deviser
of petty frauds for robbing poor people of a few stamps on every
convenient occasion.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/facing130.jpg" width="400" alt="facing130">
<div class="caption">
<p>As she bent over him a sudden mad impulse to clasp her in
his arms seized him.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When he had timidly asked to be shown the vacant apartments in
Woodbine Cottage, Mrs. Kenly had decided at once that he would prove
amenable to any rules and regulations she might like to impose upon
him. He agreed with such a deprecating air to every suggestion she made
as to the points which seemed desirable in a well-conducted lodger
that her heart quite warmed to him. He thought sixpence a scuttle for
coals "most reasonable." He agreed that the room was certainly worth
more than the seven and sixpence weekly paid in advance, which Mrs.
Kenly demanded for rent and attendance. He exhibited the liveliest
satisfaction when Mrs. Kenly informed him that beyond a shilling a week
for "gas" she charged "no extras," and came to a most satisfactory
arrangement regarding the meals he proposed to take at home, and the
price he was to pay for them. Mrs. Kenly thought in her own mind that
a bachelor was much more profitable than a maiden of mature years,
and congratulated herself on her luck. When she further learned from
Cornelius Jessel that he was engaged in "literary pursuits," and would
not be disturbed by many callers, though his work might sometimes keep
him in the house all day, she thought she was indeed in luck's way, and
was fully prepared to defend her action when called upon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>She found it necessary to do so from the first. Inspector Kenly
objected most strenuously to the presence of a male lodger in the
house. He objected still more when he had made the acquaintance of
his new tenant. He disliked Jessel's appearance. The pale hair, pale
complexion, pale watery eyes roused his antipathy. He disliked Jessel's
manner still more. The lodger did not walk as an ordinary man, he
glided from place to place. He glided down the stairs and out of the
front door, and he glided in again and up the stairs so that no one
ever knew whether he was in or out of the house. His apologetic manner,
his dislike of going abroad by day, his abstemiousness, his apparent
lack of acquaintances, the very decorum of his habits were to Inspector
Kenly reasons for suspicion. The Inspector was no mean judge of men,
and he dubbed Jessel thief at sight. "Some day we shall find him and
the spoons missing," he said to his wife. She laughed at the idea.</p>

<p>"Well, if that should happen, I shall depend upon you
to recover them for me," she replied.</p>

<p>She did not believe that there was any harm in the man. But the
Inspector was so certain in his own mind that he spent some hours
searching the records at Scotland Yard, after having secured some of
his tenant's finger prints by a trick. The search was quite useless.
There was no record against him. Hitherto he had always managed to
evade the law.</p>

<p>It was the fact that he had been unable to secure the proof
he desired that constituted Inspector Kenly's third and greatest
grievance. Everything seemed to be going wrong with him. He had been so
certain that he would be able to provide good and sufficient reasons to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
his wife for getting rid of the detested lodger that, when he found
that he was unable to do so, he began to doubt whether his instincts
were playing him false.</p>

<p>Thus brooding he turned into Melpomene Road. Several
yards before him was an elderly man wearing a
clerical collar with an overcoat threadbare at the seams,
a little black bag in his hand, and a Bible under his arm,
and slightly dragging one foot after him as he walked.</p>

<p>"Non-conformist parson," commented the Inspector to himself. The
stranger was looking each side of him as he passed up the street, but,
on reaching Woodbine Cottage he paused, lifted the latch of the gate
and, entering, made his way to the front door.</p>

<p>"A visitor for the lodger," commented the Inspector, and he
passed by his own door to the end of the road. When he returned, the
non-conformist parson had disappeared. The Inspector let himself
quietly into the house with his latchkey. An opportunity was afforded
him of learning something concerning the lodger which he determined
not to neglect. He said nothing to Mrs. Kenly as to his intention, for
his suspicion that the tenant of the first floor front was, to use
his own expressive phrase, "on the crook," might not prove capable of
demonstration. He merely said that he had business that evening, and
could only remain in the house a few minutes. So Mrs. Kenly popped
the tea in the teapot forthwith, dished up the haddock, which had
been simmering over the pan on the kitchen fire, and directed all her
attention to supplying her husband's requirements. While thus engaged
the lodger's bell rang, but she paid no heed to the summons until she
had seen that the Inspector's needs were all provided for.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>"I expect Mr. Jessel wants a cup of tea for his visitor,"
she remarked, when the bell tinkled a second time.</p>

<p>"So he has begun to have callers at last, has he?"
remarked the Inspector.</p>

<p>"It's the first time since he come to live with us, a month ago last
Tuesday," replied Mrs. Kenly, "and a nice-spoken old clergyman, too.
I always thought as he was a most respectable young man, and now I'm
sure of it." She bustled off to answer the bell, in the absence of the
youthful maid of all work, who had been sent out with the two young
Kenlys to picnic on the Common.</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly said nothing. When Mrs. Kenly returned
and prepared a tray with two cups on it, he chatted
about indifferent things. He finished his tea leisurely.
"I'll just have a rinse before I go out again," he remarked
to his wife. He closed the door of the little sitting-room
behind him, and mounted the stairs. When
occasion required, Inspector Kenly, in spite of his six
feet of muscular manhood, could be as light-footed as
any cat, and not a stair creaked as he mounted them to
his own bedroom, the door of which was opposite that of
the room in which the lodger was entertaining his guest.
In his own doorway he paused and listened. He could
hear a murmur of voices, that was all. Stay! His
trained ear caught the sound of a name twice repeated,
"Guy Hora." It meant nothing to him, but he noted it
instinctively. The voices dropped to a murmur again,
and the Inspector returned downstairs, and, after lighting
his pipe and telling his wife that he did not expect to be
very late home, he slipped out of the back door and made
his way leisurely to the end of the street.</p>

<p>His meal had put him in a much more contented frame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
of mind, and, as he puffed away at his pipe, he smiled at
the thought that he should be engaged in keeping observation
on his own house. It reminded him of his
early days in the detective force, and he remembered how
often he had waited hours without anything rewarding
his patience. This time his patience was not severely
tried. He had not finished his first pipeful of tobacco
when his lodger's visitor made his appearance, and passing
along the street took a turning which led to the nearest
railway station.</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly walked briskly in the same direction,
but by another route. It was slightly longer than the
one Lynton Hora had taken, but Kenly was there first.
He was on the platform before Hora, and was in the
guard's brake almost as soon as the train came into the
platform. He observed that his lodger's visitor carefully
scanned the carriages as they passed him and entered an
empty first-class compartment. "Hard up parsons don't
usually travel first-class," commented Inspector Kenly to
himself.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes fixed on the door of that compartment all the way
to the terminus, but it remained unopened until Waterloo was reached.
There, watching more keenly than ever, he chuckled at his own acumen
when his observation was rewarded by the sight of a very differently
attired person to the shabbily clad old clergyman, who had entered
the compartment, stepping from the train. The clerical hat and collar
and the spectacles had disappeared. The shabby overcoat carried on
Hora's arm revealed only a new silk lining which was not out of
keeping with the smartly cut lounge suit Hora was wearing beneath.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
His stoop abandoned, he seemed three or four inches taller, but he
still carried his bag, and Kenly could not have mistaken the limp.</p>

<p>The detective walked briskly along the platform to the exit of the
station, giving one glance at Hora's face as he passed him. Hora was
signalling a cab and paid no attention. At the exit the detective
paused. The cab which contained the man he was following drove through
the gate, and he heard the address which the cabman shouted to the
clerk in the cab registry office. He gained the street, and, hailing an
empty cab passing at the moment, gave the driver an address two doors
distant from that which had reached his ears. A block in the traffic at
a street corner enabled him to catch up with the cab he pursued. Nor
did he again lose sight of it until Hora, alighting, paid the man, and
entered his own residence.</p>

<p>The detective looked at his watch. Seven o'clock! There was plenty
of time before him. He also dismissed his cabman, and strolled along
to the building which Hora had entered. Unless his memory was at fault
he guessed that he would have very little difficulty in obtaining all
the information he desired. He knew the block of mansions, and he knew
that a year or two previously an old comrade of his was employed there
in the capacity of hall porter. His memory had not deceived him. As he
reached the door his old comrade opened it to allow a lady to pass.
Recognition was mutual. Inspector Kenly entered. When he left he was
acquainted with all that the servants in Westminster Mansions knew of
Lynton Hora's household, but the information he had gleaned afforded
him no sort of a hint as to the nature of the connection which existed
between him and Cornelius Jessel, the detective's literary lodger.

<small>POISONED WORDS</small>
</h2></div>

<p>A hundred times a day Myra told herself that she would forget Guy,
that she would tear every tender memory of him from her heart, and a
hundred times a day her heart cried out passionately that forgetfulness
were impossible, since every time she saw him her hunger for his love
grew fiercer. There came a day when she realised that it was impossible
to persuade herself that she might ever forget, and, when she thus
surrendered herself to the bitter-sweet reflection of the folly of
bestowing a love which was unreturned, she realised also that certainly
and surely Guy was drifting further away from her.</p>

<p>If he had remained under the same roof, she would have been content
for the relationship of brother and sister to endure, but, when she
could no longer watch over his outgoings and incomings, she became
possessed of a devouring desire to know how and where he spent his
time. With a woman's intuition she guessed that he could not remain
fancy free. He was not that type of man. She knew that to him the
feminine complement would inevitably be sought and found. She had
thought that he might have found that complement in her. When Hora had
told her that she had been too near Guy, she had trusted his knowledge
of the world, but after Guy had been living away from them for a month,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
and he had shown no alteration in his demeanour, she told herself that
Hora had merely lied to her to prevent her protesting against a plan
which was to place Guy out of her reach. She thought she saw that plan
maturing as the weeks passed and Guy's visits became fewer and fewer.
Hora did not apparently mind when he only came in for a brief half-hour
in the morning during a whole week, and made that visit merely to
announce that he was going out of town on the following day, and was
uncertain when he would return.</p>

<p>Myra remembered that six months previously he would
have acted very differently. Then any plan formulating
in his mind would have been discussed between all of
them, then she would have known where he was going,
and when he might be expected to return.</p>

<p>She did Lynton Hora an injustice. He was in reality
as much perturbed as herself at the alteration in Guy's
demeanour. But he could await the explanation with
more equanimity, since he had taken steps to discover
the reason. He did not for a moment suppose that Guy's
opinions were undergoing any change. Even, as Myra,
he suspected a feminine reason for Guy's reserve on the
subject of his movements. He did not attempt to force
a confidence from the young man; he was far too astute.
He had no belief in confidences that were not volunteered.</p>

<p>Guy was glad that he had not been asked for an explanation as to his
movements. He felt ashamed that he could have accepted an invitation
to the house of his supposed father's enemy. Yet he could not have
resisted the opportunity which would be afforded him of spending whole
days in the sweet companionship of Meriel Challys. So, after his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
acceptation of the invitation given him he had stayed away from
Westminster Mansions. He had not thought of Myra at all. They had been
boy and girl together, confidantes, playmates, brother and sister.
The idea of any other relationship had never for a moment crossed his
mind, and when he bade her a careless good-bye and mechanically kissed
her cheek he had not the slightest suspicion that her heart was in
a tumult, that at the faintest encouragement she would have thrown
herself into his arms and offered her lips.</p>

<p>She gave no indication of the emotion which swayed
her then. But all day she brooded over the coldness of
the farewell alone in her room. Not with tears, the time
for that relief was not yet come.</p>

<p>Hora had observed, but said nothing. But when she
did not make her appearance at the dinner-table he went
to her room. The door was locked. He began to be
afraid. But she answered to his knocking that she had a
headache and could not eat. He reasoned with her, and
commanded that she should join him at the table. She
was on the point of refusing, but habit was strong. She
obeyed his peremptory request, though sullenly. Hora
took no notice of her mood, while the meal was being
served, but when it was over and Myra rose to leave he
rose too and followed her. She went direct towards her
own room. He checked her.</p>

<p>"I must speak to you to-night, Myra," he said. "I
have something important to say to you."</p>

<p>She passed through the door which Hora held open
for her without a word and threw herself into a chair.
She anticipated some reproach, but she was far too
miserable to care for reproaches.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>Hora was silent awhile after he had entered and seated
himself opposite her. Then he spoke sharply. "What
have you been saying or doing to Guy to drive him away
from his home?"</p>

<p>The suddenness, the preposterous nature, of the
charge aroused Myra as nothing else could have done.
Her lethargy vanished. The colour flashed to her cheeks
and the light to her eyes, though surprise tied her tongue
so that Hora had time to repeat the query.</p>

<p>"What have I done to Guy?" she answered. "What
do you mean? Do you think that Iâ€”that Iâ€”would do
anything to send him away?"</p>

<p>"I can conceive of no other reason why he should have
so deserted his home of late," answered Hora coldly. He
was deliberately provoking a storm, and it burst upon
him.</p>

<p>"I am not quite the fool you suppose me to be, Commandatore," she
cried hotly. "You cannot impose upon me with the shallow pretence that
you think I am responsible for Guy's absence. I am not blind. I can see
plainly enough that your intention has been to get Guy away and there
can only be one motive for your wishing to do so. You think he can do
far better for himself than to mate with a girl you picked up from the
gutter."</p>

<p>"Suppose I have thought so; what then?" asked
Hora. "What cause have you for complaint?"</p>

<p>"None," she answered, her voice full of bitterness. "Save that you
have allowed me to live in a fool's paradise, that you have encouraged
me to believe that one day the impossible might happen, that you have
encouraged me to believe that there was no one you would so welcome as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
daughter as myself. I don't know why you should have instilled such a
belief in my mind, Commandatore, unless you have hated me all the time.
You must have done so, and now you should be glad. You have made me
sufferâ€”well, now you can gloat over the thought."</p>

<p>"Made you suffer, have I?" answered Hora scornfully.
"You don't know what suffering is. The vapourings
of a love-sick girl. Bah! I have no patience with
such sentimental bleatings."</p>

<p>Myra rose from her chair, pale now with anger, "And
now you insult me," she cried.</p>

<p>He would have interrupted her, but she overpowered his words with
a torrent of her own. "Oh, you have the right to insult me as you
please; I don't question it. Did you not buy me, as you have told me
often enough, body and soul for a piece of gold and a bottle of gin.
The master cannot insult the slave, you will say. I suppose I ought to
smile at your reproaches, but when you accuse me of having driven Guy
awayâ€”it is too much, Commandatore. I cannot bear that accusation, at
least."</p>

<p>She dropped limply into the chair from which she had
risen. Her face fell forward into her hands, and her
whole body was shaken with a storm of sobs.</p>

<p>Hora was silent. He had provoked the storm. He waited for its
subsidence before he broached the subject he had in his mind.
Presently tears came to Myra's relief, the crystal drops broke through
her fingers. She lay back in the chair exhausted by the cyclone of
passion.</p>

<p>"I have something yet to say, Myra," remarked Hora
quietly. "I believe you when you say that you have done
nothing to drive Guy away, but that belief makes it necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
to look for another explanation. Guy is of the age
when there is only one possible explanation. He is blind
to your beauty, Myra; have you any idea as to any other
woman who is likely to have attracted him?"</p>

<p>There was a subtle meaning in Hora's voice which arrested Myra's
wandering attention. She looked up. Tears had reddened her eyes, a
hardness came into her face. She was almost ugly. She crushed her
handkerchief into a ball.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Commandatore?" she asked.
Then, as she met Hora's eyes, she bent forward to him,
"You know something, you know something." She
forced the words from between clenched teeth.</p>

<p>Hora made no answer, and she continued, "You need
not trouble about breaking it gently, Commandatore.
Who is it?"</p>

<p>The Commandatore was unmoved by her emotion.</p>

<p>"I am asking you, Myra. As yet I have only a suspicion.
I was wondering whether you could not give me
confirmation."</p>

<p>"Don't play with me any longer, Commandatore,"
she pleaded. "I am not a child."</p>

<p>He seemed to be moved by the appeal, for he answered
with animation, "Indeed, Myra, you do me an injustice.
I know nothing certainly, I only suspect; and I am blaming
you, Myra, youâ€”for allowing Guy to be taken from
us."</p>

<p>She gazed at him stupidly, while she repeated his
words, "You are blaming me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, "I am blaming you. You are
young, you are beautiful. Day by day you have been in
Guy's company, and yet you have allowed him to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
stolen away from us. If you have not driven him away,
at least you have made no effort to keep him."</p>

<p>Myra was silent. Hora was speaking vehemently and,
though she had learned to doubt his every word, yet it
was difficult to doubt his sincerity now. The man continued:</p>

<p>"You have told me you love. I doubt if you can know the meaning of
the word. Love does not sit with hands folded idly while the beloved
is stolen away. Love fights for existence against all rivals. It is
insistent. It will not be denied. Beauty is its weapon. The knowledge
of the primitive instinct of a man to a maid is a sufficient education
in strategy. Are you such a fool that you did not see that it was in
your power to have kept Guy at your will?"</p>

<p>Myra was forced to protest. "To thrust myself on
Guy. To be repulsedâ€”the shame of it, Commandatore,"
she answered weakly.</p>

<p>"Bah!" replied Hora. "A man will fight for a
woman, and take no shame in his repulse. Why not a
woman for a man? Are you of such ordinary stuff, such
common fustian, that you will tamely stand by while
some milk-and-water chit takes your natural mate from
you? You had better go back to the gutter, if so."</p>

<p>There was scorn in his words, scorn in the tone of his
voice, and if Hora intended to rouse the woman's spirit
the words did not fail of their purpose. Though she
winced under the sting of his speech, her eyes flashed
fire again.</p>

<p>"You do me less than justice," she said. "Have I
not always been obedient? You have never bade me
please myself. Always it has been, some day if you are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
dutiful, Myra, you shall have the chance. I have waited
and waited, and now you have nothing but scorn."</p>

<p>Hora rose, and, passing behind the girl, bent over her
chair.</p>

<p>"It may not be too late yet," he said. "You remember when I said to
you that the day might come when I should bid you take Guy's heart from
him, toss it away, trample on it, break it, or store it away with your
trinketsâ€”do with it as you please? That day has come, Myra." His voice
whispered, almost hissed, the latter words in her ear.</p>

<p>"It is too late," she cried in reply.</p>

<p>"It is not too late," insisted Hora passionately. "Too
late is the excuse of cowardice. Guy will come back.
It will be your duty to keep him, to make him forget all
else but yourself."</p>

<p>"But he cares nothing for me," she cried.</p>

<p>"That is your fault," he answered readily. "Heaven! You a woman
and hold yourself so cheaply. Look in the glass and compare what you
see there with the women you meet day by day." His voice dropped to a
whisper again. "Guy's eyes have been closed to your beauty. Open them.
He has yet to learn that a man's will dies when a woman's arms are
around him, and her lips are pressed against his. Teach him the lesson,
Myra, for I tell you that if such a passion as yours does not awaken
a response in his heart, he is much less than man. You want to know
how to make victory certain? Take lesson of Delilah, but do not let
too many opportunities pass. Remember that once you win him he is won
forever. I am on your side."</p>

<p>Myra listened, fascinated by Hora's subtle suggestions.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
He ceased speaking and stole softly out of the room. She did not hear
him depart. Her mind was in a tumult. There was joy in the thought that
the Commandatore had at last not merely given her permission to win
Guy, but had urged her to the conquest. There was dread lest another,
the unknown rival, should already have won him. There was doubt in her
mind that she might fail, but that was tempered with a knowledge of
her own beauty. She hastened to her own room and asked the mirror for
information. Yes, beauty of face and form were both hers. Gladly would
she have laid her beauties at Guy's feet, but to use them to entrap
himâ€”a flood of crimson overwhelmed her at the thought. And yet, rather
than another should take him from her, there was no shame to which she
would not cheerfully submit. Even if Guy should scorn her, she would
still have tasted the fierce joy of possession.</p>

<p>Cunningly had Lynton Hora made use of his knowledge of the girl's
complex nature. He had heaped fuel upon the flames of her desire,
he had artfully suggested that it was within her power to light an
answering flame in Guy's heart. He had taunted her with cowardice in
submitting without effort to a rival's success; he had even recalled
her humble origin to her mind as if he would make it clear that she
could not stoop to conquer. And the poison which he had dropped in her
ear entered into her veins until it filled her whole being. But Guy did
not return.

<small>THE SHADOW-MAN</small>
</h2></div>

<p>The whole of Cornelius Jessel's cringing heart and
slinking soul was put into the work which the Master
had given him to do. He loved to peer and pry into
other people's business, even when no hope of any immediate
advantage to himself promised to reward his curiosity.
But when such work produced solid, golden
results, no one in the world could have devoted himself
with more keenness to it than "Ma" Norton's "Shadder
Man." And the Master was no niggard. When he paid
his visit to Inspector Kenly's house in Melpomene Road,
he had left behind him twenty pieces of gold. "If I
am satisfied with you, I shall continue to pay you the
same amount at the end of every four weeks," he had
said; "but remember that I shall do so only on condition
that you act strictly on my instructions."</p>

<p>Cornelius had protested a determination to devote himself
absolutely to fulfilling his employer's commands,
while his eyes glistened at the sight of the gold.</p>

<p>The Master did not trust entirely to the spy's avarice. "You had
better obey," he sneered, "for if you do not you will probably find
that one or two little incidents in your career, with which you have
not hitherto been identified, will become known in quarters where you
are not likely to be viewed with any special favour."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span></p>

<p>Cornelius Jessel had shivered at the tone his patron
adopted, and had renewed his protestations.</p>

<p>"I warn you first," the Master had continued coldly,
"so that you may be free to refuse or accept as you
please. Once you accept, however, remember that you
will have to reckon with me, and I never forget to repay
the man who plays me false."</p>

<p>Jessel had accepted when he had learned that he was required to do
nothing which could by any chance bring him into conflict with the law,
that he was merely required to watch over and report upon the doings
of a certain Guy Hora. One reservation the Master had been compelled
to make, even though he realised that it might have the very opposite
effect he desired. He warned Cornelius to make no inquiries concerning
the young man's own family. "I know all about his father and sister,"
he remarked, giving his own address, "and, besides wasting your time,
any interference in that direction might upset my plans. What I want
you to do is to find out who are his friends and all about them, what
houses he visits and for what purpose. You know the way to set about it
by getting hold of the servants and so on."</p>

<p>Yes, Cornelius knew, and it tickled his vanity to think
that the Master had realised his talents in that direction.</p>

<p>Then another thought had seemed to strike Hora. "The young man," he
said, "has a manservant to look after him, who was dismissed from his
last berth for drunkenness. He pretends to be retrieving his character.
Wellâ€”if by any possibility he were to lose it againâ€”I think I could
manage to get you his berth. I need hardly point out that in such a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
position you might be in a position to earn the salary I propose to pay
you with great case to yourself."</p>

<p>Cornelius understood. He suspected from the Master's words that Guy
was a well-feathered pigeon upon whom the eyes of a hawk were fixed.
When the time came for plucking, he realised that one or two stray
feathers might easily be blown in the servant's way. He said nothing of
his thoughts in this direction, but, when the Master had left him, he
was as keen to find out all he could concerning Guy as his patron could
have wished. He would have started that same night only he had been
forbidden to do so.</p>

<p>Accordingly, it was not until the next day that Guy
became possessed of two shadows. He was not aware
of the fact. He did not know that outside the door of
his chambers in the Albany a shadow lurked to mingle
with his own, and to follow him wherever he went. He
did not know that it accompanied him to his tailor's, and
peered through the window while he was fitted with the
latest thing in waistcoats. He did not know that it rode
behind his cab to the club, and waited there until he
emerged, and then, picking its companion up, went hand
in hand with it to the theatre, where it was lost in the
shadows of the pit, while he sat in the stalls. He could
not know, therefore, that this second shadow was utterly
unlike his own, in that it possessed an avid curiosity to
learn what he was doing within the doors which alone
proved a barrier to it. He did not know that when it
had followed him three days in one week to Captain
Marven's town-house that the door no longer proved
impassable to it. He could not have known that when he
was in the drawing-room Cornelius Jessel was in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
kitchen eagerly listening to details of the gossip of the
servants' hall which had already decided that "that nice
young gentleman, Mr. Guy Hora," seemed to have "attracted
Miss Meriel's fancy for sure," and that both the
"master and the mistress were just doing their level best
to bring the match about."</p>

<p>Day by day Lynton Hora had received the report of
his spy, and thus he had learned what he had to fear.
He had early taken an opportunity for enlisting Myra's
aid to recall the wanderer when the opportunity should
offer. But, though he had learned something, he was by
no means satisfied with the information.</p>

<p>He wanted a more intimate knowledge of the progress
of events, and, meeting the shadow-man by appointment,
he harped again upon the desirability of the shadow
being within the very same roof as the person to which
it was attached.</p>

<p>The shadow from that moment transferred itself from
master to man. It followed him on his errands. It
gained his acquaintance. It proved itself a merry, affable
shadow, indeed, with a pleasant fund of genial anecdote,
a carelessness about the tightness of its purse-strings,
so that James Under, whose one thought for the fortnight
he had already been in Guy's service had been to
escape the pursuing, remorseless alcohol fiend, welcomed
the acquaintance as an ally. In his off-hours, and they
were many, the temptation to Under to turn in to the
nearest saloon bar had been almost irresistible; until he
met with Jessel. After the meeting Cornelius proved an
innocuous alternative. He did not appear anxious to
cement the acquaintance with a drink. Under was glad
when he met his new friend. They spent a whole Sunday
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
afternoon in the park together, and nothing stronger
than tea passed their lips. They went to a music-hall in
company, and ginger beer was the innocuous refreshment
which Jessel proposed. He was far too astute to
hasten his plans until the fitting time. That arrived
soon enough for his purpose.</p>

<p>One evening, when Jessel had arranged to meet his friend for a visit
to the theatre, Under met him with the information that Guy required
him to return to his chambers about ten. The evening was wet.</p>

<p>"It's no use thinking of the theatre," remarked Jessel
to his companion, sheltering him with his umbrella, as
they walked down Piccadilly towards the Circus. "We
shall have to postpone our visit until another evening.
But"â€”he stopped suddenlyâ€”"I tell you what, Under.
Why shouldn't we be swells for once in our lives? I'm
in funds to-night, and I just fancy myself dining at one
of the tip-top restaurants."</p>

<p>"I don't thinkâ€”â€”" began Under, and paused. "My
togs," he added expressively.</p>

<p>"The guvnor's got more than one suit, hasn't he?"
asked Cornelius. "You will have plenty of time to
change on your return."</p>

<p>The valet was tickled with the idea. "It would be a
bit of all right," he murmured gleefully. "I've often
thought I'd like to be one of themselves just to know
what it felt like to be waited on instead of having to
wait."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Cornelius impulsively. He
wheeled his companion round, and hurried him back to
Guy's chambers. But outside the door Under paused.
"What about you?" he asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Cornelius laughed.</p>

<p>"I intended to 'ave dinner by myself somewhere if
you couldn't come to the theatre," he remarked, "an' I
prepared accordin'."</p>

<p>Under had bestowed small attention on his companion's
attire, but now he looked more closely at him. Jessel
unbuttoned his overcoat, and the valet observed that
he wore correct evening dress. His last scruples vanished.</p>

<p>"Come inside and wait. I shall be ready in a jiffy,"
he said.</p>

<p>Cornelius entered Guy's abode, and condescended to smoke one of
Guy's cigarettes, while his companion rigged himself out in one of
his master's evening suits. Under was not long in making the change.
He strutted into the room with a most consequential air when he made
his reappearance. One of Guy's silk hats was on his head, one of Guy's
white waistcoats had been made to meet round his waist, displaying one
of Guy's newest shirts. He carried one of Guy's light overcoats over
his arm, and selecting one of Guy's cigarettes he lit it and professed
himself to be "fit for anything."</p>

<p>The two sallied forth again. Reaching the street, Cornelius hailed
a passing hansom cab, giving the driver the address of a fashionable
restaurant close at hand.</p>

<p>"Why not walk?" exclaimed Under.</p>

<p>"Real toffs never walk," replied Jessel, and Under
was dumb.</p>

<p>The next quarter of an hour passed as time passes in dreamland. The
bowing commissionaire at the door, the unobtrusive waiters, the gaily
lighted room, with nearly every table occupied with parties of diners,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
the flowers, the beautiful women, seemed unsubstantial. He had seen
them all before, it is true, it was no unaccustomed sight, but the
circumstances were so different. Now all this was prepared for himâ€”for
his own especial delectation.</p>

<p>He awoke suddenly. An ice-pail was wheeled beside the table, and
the wine waiter, lifting a gold-foiled bottle from the glittering
crystals, drew the cork. He could not refuse, though for one moment
the ghost of a resolution flitted across his mental vision. "Only this
once," he murmured to himself. For thirty years, ever since he had been
fifteen years of age, he had served. He was not going to allow his one
evening of enjoyment of being served to be spoiled by any resolutions
made by the servitor. His eyes lingered on the champagne lovingly. The
delicate froth melted and the rising bubbles as they burst set free the
imprisoned breath of the vine. He raised the glass and sipped. Then he
nodded his head sagely.</p>

<p>"There's no fault to be found with your taste in champagne,"
he remarked to Jessel.</p>

<p>"I thought that we might as well do the thing properly while we were
about it," was the reply. In one of his permutations Cornelius had
occupied the post of butler in a wine merchant's family, and he had
learned something of the niceties of brands and vintages, though in
this respect he could not claim to the connoisseurship of Under, whose
thirty years in the best families had left him little to learn on the
subject.</p>

<p>Under emptied his glass, the attentive waiter refilled it. He
lounged back in his chair, and drew a long breath of delight. The wine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
filled him with a pleasant sense of exhilaration. He was quite wide
awake now. He looked about him. Here and there at tables were the faces
of people he knew; he could count three of his previous employers, and
a dozen others to whose wants he had at one time or another ministered.
He turned to Jessel and began to tell him items of scandal respecting
the diners at the other tables. Course followed course. The first
bottle of champagne was followed by a second. His tongue tripped a
little by the time that was finished. He had entirely forgotten the
passage of time, forgotten also that at ten o'clock his master was
expecting him. They wound up the dinner with liqueurs, coffee, and
cigars. The room had nearly emptied when Jessel paid the bill and they
rose to leave. When they came into the street, Under turned to his
host.</p>

<p>"The finesh time've ever had in m' life," he remarked.
"Never had sush time, ole f'ler."</p>

<p>A clock struck ten. "Had somethin' to do, f'get wa'
it was," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Come and have another drink, and perhaps you'll
remember," said Jessel. He had drunk but sparingly
himself.</p>

<p>"Itsh my turn this time," said Under.</p>

<p>He took Jessel's arm, for he found the pavement a
little unsteady. The two dropped first into one cafÃ©,
then into a second. The time slipped away. Under grew
more incoherent in speech as he poured more drinks
down his throat. Jessel thought it time for him to go
home. He recalled to Under's befogged intelligence the
fact that his employer would be expecting him.</p>

<p>"Tha'sh all ri'," said the valet, "goo' sort, my guv'nor.
Let him wait a bit."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Jessel had no intention that Guy should wait any longer. He piloted
his charge into the street again. The pavement was rockier than ever.
Under lurched and fell into a puddle. When he picked himself up, Guy's
coat was covered with mud. Guy's hat was also crushed and muddy.
Cornelius called a cab, and they drove together to the Albany. They
had great difficulty in passing the porter at the gate, but Jessel
persuaded him to allow them to enter. He piloted his charge to the door
of Guy's chambers. There he propped him against the door, and, pressing
the electric button, drifted away into the shadows. Unseen himself, he
watched the development of his plot. He saw the door open, and Under
sprawl forward into the entrance hall. He heard Guy's sharp exclamation
of amazement. That was all. The door closed. He waited some minutes
longer, half expecting that Under would be thrust out then and there,
but as nothing of the sort happened he betook himself homeward.</p>

<p>"I think you have done for yourself, my good Under," he murmured.
"I suppose I had better let the Master know, so that he will be
prepared." He felt no compunction at the thought that he had perhaps
ruined a fellow-creature. His chief feeling was one of gratification
at the artistic manner in which he had carried out his plans, to which
was added satisfaction that his patron would pay the expenses of his
evening's amusement without a murmur.</p>

<p>Under had indeed "done for himself," as Cornelius had phrased the
possible result. Guy had a horror of drunkenness. He had required
Under's services that evening, for he was expecting friends to drop in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
for a smoke and a chat and possibly a game of bridge. Some of the
friends had been there when Under had been precipitated into the
entrance hall on the opening of the door. Guy had felt no pity for the
backslider. He saw that it was useless to remonstrate then. Under was
hopelessly incapable of speech, or even of holding himself erect. With
the aid of one of his friends Guy had carried the man to his room and
laid him on his bed. He recognised that the valet had garbed himself
in his (Guy's) clothes. He made up his mind to the course he should
pursue, and carried it out without hesitation.</p>

<p>When Under, pale-faced and shaky, appeared the next
morning, Guy said nothing until breakfast was served
and cleared away. Then he told the man to pack up his
clothes and depart. He would not listen to the excuses
Under had ready. He felt that he had done the man
more than justice when he had paid him a month's
wages over and above that due to him, and he breathed
more freely when the man had departed.</p>

<p>An hour later there came a ring at his bell. He
answered the door personally. Cornelius Jessel stood
there.</p>

<p>"Mr. Guy Hora, sir?" he asked deferentially.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Guy.</p>

<p>Jessel handed him a note. Guy recognised Lynton Hora's handwriting
and tore open the envelope. "Dear Guy," he read, "I don't know whether
you could do anything amongst any of your friends for the bearer of
this missive. He isn't a very prepossessing-looking person, but I know
him to be a capable valet, and he is quite sober. Of course he is
stupid, but all servants are that or they wouldn't be servants. Some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
years ago he valeted me for a while, and, running up against him in the
street the other day, he told me he was out of a berth, and I foolishly
promised to see if I could find him one. If you can relieve me of the
responsibility, do. When are you coming to see us again? It seems
ages since you looked us up, and Myra is crying her eyes out in your
absence. Yours, L. H."</p>

<p>That same evening, while Cornelius was sedately
laying out Guy's evening clothes in readiness for his
new employer's return to dress for dinner, Inspector
Kenly was learning almost with dismay that his literary
lodger had that day arrived home, packed his
boxes in a hurry, paid a week's rent in lieu of notice, and
departed without giving a hint as to the reason for his
sudden departure, or whither he was bound.

<small>INSPECTOR KENLY FINDS A CLUE</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Inspector Kenly had good cause for regretting the departure of the
man whose arrival in his home had been the source of so much annoyance
to him, for Cornelius Jessel had become possessed of professional
interest to him. His enquiries into the leakage of information
contained in the Foreign Office despatches had at last borne fruit. He
had learned that Lynton Hora had been a large speculator for the fall
which had taken place upon the publication of the stolen information,
and that the Commandatore had netted at least one hundred thousand
pounds as the result. It had been easy to identify the successful
speculator with the pseudo-clergyman who had called upon Cornelius
Jessel. The detective had counted a great deal upon obtaining useful
information about Hora from his lodger.</p>

<p>But the part Hora played in the Stock Exchange
panic was not the only item of information which had
resulted from his investigations. He had found that a
certain Guy Marven had also speculated successfully.
The fact that the name was identical with that of the
King's Messenger who had carried the de-coded despatch
from London to Sandringham did not lead him
to suspect that Captain Marven could be the culprit.
To his mind the use of the name pointed in another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
direction altogether. "If the Captain had been in it,"
he argued, "he would have taken precious good care
that his name would never have appeared. It looks as
if whoever did the job has used Marven's name in order
to throw suspicion upon him."</p>

<p>Deprived of his hope of obtaining any information from Jessel,
Inspector Kenly bethought himself of his old friend, the hall porter at
Westminster Mansions. He began to haunt the place. Indeed, the revival
of interest in his old comrade was quite touching. However, the old
friend had lived long enough to understand that something more than
interest in himself was at work, when a busy man like Inspector Kenly
should happen to be passing twice in one day, and on each occasion have
a whole hour to spend in gossip.</p>

<p>He told the Inspector so at last.</p>

<p>Kenly laughed. "You're quite right," he said,
"there's not the slightest use in trying to hoodwink
an old hand like you. Only, you know what it is in the
Yard, we are not allowed to take our closest friends
into our confidence. I only wish I could tell a man of
your intelligence what I'm after." He sighed, as if
such a conversation would have been a heartfelt relief.</p>

<p>The hall porter was flattered. "At least you can tell
me who it is you are enquiring about?" he said.</p>

<p>"I don't know that I ought to do so," replied Kenly
dubiously. "But," he added with the air of a man
making up his mind to impart a tremendous secret, "I'll
risk it, Dwyer. I know that you will treat anything I
say as strictly confidential."</p>

<p>"Of course, you may. I hope you know me well
enough for that," replied Dwyer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>"It's those Hora people on the top floor that I am
anxious to find out something about," he remarked.</p>

<p>"The Horas," said the man, and a disappointed look
spread over his face. "There can't be anything against
them; they are just about the best tenants we've got in
the place, been here ten years, too. Now, if you'd said
the Lorimers, or that foxy little chap Griddle, I could
have understood it."</p>

<p>"Still it is all about the Horas that I want to know,"
persisted Kenly. "Tell me all about them, Dwyer."</p>

<p>The hall porter did so, and was surprised himself to
learn how little he knew about them. There was only
one scrap of information which promised to be of any
service to the detective. His ears caught the name of
Guy. He remembered that Guy Marven had been the
name of the other operator.</p>

<p>"The son is named Guy?" he asked. "Does he live
at home?"</p>

<p>"Just left us," was the reply. "Gone to live in the
Albany on his own account. Let me see; it was
threeâ€”" He calculated the weeks on his fingers.
"No, four weeks ago."</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly perceived that the date coincided with
that of the speculation.</p>

<p>He thanked his old comrade, and strolled thoughtfully across
the park and dropped into Vine Street Police Station, where he was
cordially welcomed by the detective inspector on duty.</p>

<p>With him Kenly did not waste any time in preliminaries.
When he had discussed one or two matters of
official interest, he broached his object. "I want to
find out something about one of the tenants in the Albany,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
he remarked. "Are any of your people here
friendly with the man at the gate?"</p>

<p>"Isn't your card enough?" suggested the local detective.</p>

<p>"No," said Kenly. "It's a very delicate matter. I
don't want to appear to be making any especial enquiries."</p>

<p>"I had better come along with you myself, then,"
was the prompt response. "I know the old chap
pretty well, and I don't think he will try to pull my leg,
as he usually does when people ask him questions."</p>

<p>"That sort of man, is he?" asked Kenly, as they left
the police station in company.</p>

<p>"Fly as they make 'em," was the response. "There
are usually more than one or two young bloods living
there, and when they don't pay up and the writ-men are
after them, it takes a smart man to keep them out. Yet,
since the present porter has been there, not a writ has
been served in the place."</p>

<p>He proceeded to give divers illustrations of the gate-keeper's
smartness until they arrived at the gate, where Kenly received
the introduction he desired. The inspector retired with his new
acquaintance into the little hutch with the big glass window where
the gate-keeper kept watch during his hours of duty, and proceeded
to put questions. He gave no hint of the object he had in view. In
fact, he invented a purely fictitious reason to account for his
enquiries, for, when professionally engaged, the detective had the very
faintest respect for the truth, though in private life he would have
felt horribly ashamed of the slightest deviation from exact fact. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
declared that he suspected a man in Hora's employ of being concerned in
some undefined criminal practices.</p>

<p>"Which man? The old one or the new?" asked the
gate-keeper promptly.</p>

<p>"The new one," answered Kenly boldly.</p>

<p>"Not surprised to hear it at all," was the answer.
"But if you had said the last man, I could have soon
told you you were on the wrong track, for, saving the
fact that he would lift his elbow too frequently, there
was not a scrap of vice in poor James Under."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's why he left?" hazarded Kenly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the porter. "I wasn't on the gate that
night, or I would have seen that he didn't make a fool
of himself. He came home, so he told me, blind to the
world, went up to Mr. Hora's chambers, and when, in
answer to his ring, his boss opened the door, he tumbled
down inside. So next morning off he went."</p>

<p>"Poor chap," said the Inspector. "Do you know
where he's to be found. I might put something in his
way."</p>

<p>The gate-keeper searched amongst a number of scraps
of paper, unearthing one which had an address scribbled
upon it. "He left it with me in case I should hear of
a berth going," he explained.</p>

<p>"I'll look him up when I have time," said Kenly.
He was copying the address into his note-book, when the
gate-keeper nudged his arm.</p>

<p>"Here's the new man," he whispered.</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly looked up, and his surprise was expressed
in his strongest exclamation.</p>

<p>"By Henry!" he remarked.</p>

<p>Cornelius Jessel glided through the gate, a model of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
smiling decorum. Inspector Kenly wheeled round
promptly so that his back was towards the window, nor
did he turn again until Jessel's footsteps were no longer
audible.</p>

<p>"So he is your man?" remarked the gate-keeper curiously.</p>

<p>"He most certainly is my man," replied the detective
emphatically.</p>

<p>"From the first time I set eyes on him," declared the
porter, "I knew he was a criminal. What has he been
doing? I shouldn't be surprised if it was murder. He
walks for all the world like a poisoner."</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly laughed. "At present I cannot say
that he is guilty of anything," he remarked. "But I
am glad to know that he is somewhere handy when I
want to lay my hand upon him. By the way," he added
drily, "has your observation of the gait of poisoners
been extensive?"</p>

<p>The porter seemed puzzled.</p>

<p>"That's the only gate I know anything about," he
answered, nodding his head towards the entrance.</p>

<p>"Inspector Kenly smiled." "The gaitâ€”the walk of
poisoners," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the porter, and a hearty guffaw rolled up
from beneath his capacious waistcoat. "If you'd have
spoken in plain English I should have understood you.
But these newfangled wordsâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly did not explain. He set himself to amuse his new
acquaintance, and succeeded so well that, when an hour later he
declared that he must depart, he received a cordial invitation to drop
into the hutch whenever he might be passing. He had succeeded better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
than he had expected; not only had he discovered that his late lodger
was in Guy Hora's employment, but he had also been favoured with the
opportunity of making acquaintance with Guy's features, for, while he
had been chatting with the porter, Guy had driven up to the gate and
entered the building.</p>

<p>The detective began to feel that he had in his hands the threads
which, when unravelled, might lead him to some important discovery. The
unravelling might require infinite patience, but he was inured to that.
There was no detail too small for him to overlook. He went straight
from the Albany to the humble lodging in Soho, which was Under's
address. He needed all his philosophy. Under was not at home. Kenly
waited for him, waited for six hours until the valet came home, walking
unsteadily, and with a vacant look in his eye. The detective did not
speak to him. When the door closed on him he made his own way homewards
to Woodbine Cottage.</p>

<p>He was very tired when he laid his head on the pillow, but at eight
o'clock the next morning he was enquiring again for Under, and by aid
of his most persuasive smile succeeded in winning his way to the room
where the valet still lay, slumbering heavily.</p>

<p>"Here, wake up, old fellow," the detective shouted
cheerily as he closed the door, for the benefit of the landlady
who had shown him up to the room.</p>

<p>Under merely moved uneasily. A blind, with the
grime of years upon it left the room shrouded in gloom.
Kenly drew it up, and opened the window. It was a
bare apartment. Grimy bed, a single chair, a cheap
washstand in painted wood with a cracked basin standing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
upon it, a battered tin box, and a ragged strip of
carpet formed the whole of the furniture.</p>

<p>Under stirred as the light of day fell on his face.
He sat up in bed and rubbed his eyes drowsily. Then
he caught sight of his visitor and rubbed his eyes again.</p>

<p>"I say, look here," he remarked, when he had come to
the conclusion that he was not dreaming. "This is my
room, you know."</p>

<p>"That's exactly the reason why I am here," remarked
Kenly pleasantly.</p>

<p>Under stared more fixedly than before, and as Kenly
seemed quite unmoved he remarked:</p>

<p>"Well, really, it is a most awful cheek to come into
another man's room without being asked."</p>

<p>"Without being asked," said Kenly pleasantly. "You
must have a very bad memory, old chap, for your very
last words yesterday evening were, 'Don't be a minute
later than eight o'clock.'"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said Under, "I must have been
drunk."</p>

<p>"Not a bit of it," replied Kenly. "You looked as
sober as if you had been drinking eight lemon-squashes
one after the other."</p>

<p>"I swear I never did that in my life," said the valet
fervently.</p>

<p>He was wide awake by this time, and he sat bolt upright
on the bed.</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose you did last night, or you would not have gone
to bed in your boots," remarked Kenly. "But all the same, you promised
to tell me some interesting facts about your late employer, Mr. Guy
Hora, and here I am."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>Under stared more than ever. His eyes looked as if
they would pop out of his head.</p>

<p>"Iâ€”toldâ€”youâ€”that I could tell you something about
Mr. Hora?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"That's what I have come for," replied the detective.
The valet's amazement found expression at last.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" he asked, "for I'll be
hanged if I ever saw you in my life before."</p>

<p>The Inspector was enjoying his game of bluff immensely;
he played his best card.</p>

<p>"Detective Inspector Kenly of Scotland Yard," he
answered.</p>

<p>At the information Under's mouth opened as wide
as his eyes.</p>

<p>But the detective observed that there was no tinge of
fear in his amazement.</p>

<p>"Well, that is a rum go," remarked the valet, when
he recovered his speech.</p>

<p>"It most certainly is," replied Kenly. "You tell me that you are in
a position to give me important information, you invite me to call, and
then you declare that you have entirely forgotten not only your promise
but the man you made it to."</p>

<p>"But, I couldn't have made any such promise," declared
the valet earnestly, "for I have absolutely nothing
to tell. A nicer gentleman I've never had anything to
do with than Mr. Hora, and as for knowing anything
which could be of interest to the policeâ€”â€”" An idea
came into his brain. "Look here," he said, "I suppose
Mr. Hora hasn't sent you here to see if I took anything
which doesn't belong to me, because, if so, he's mistaken.
I admit I do take a drop too much now and again, though
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
I have fought hard against my little failing, but nobody's
ever said that James Under wasn't honest."</p>

<p>There was an emotional throb in the valet's voice,
and Kenly hastened to reassure him.</p>

<p>"No," he said. "My call was not in consequence of
any charge which has been made against you. It is
entirely prompted by a desire to know something of Mr.
Guy Hora."</p>

<p>"But I've nothing to tell," the valet asseverated again.</p>

<p>Kenly appeared not to hear him. "Look here, Under,"
he said, "your mind is wool-gathering this morning.
You just have a wash to freshen you up, and then we'll
go out and get some breakfast together, and have a quiet
chat."</p>

<p>The valet found it impossible to combat Kenly's persistence. He
did as he was bidden. He brushed his clothes, he arrayed himself in a
clean collar, and he meekly preceded the detective down the stairs,
and walked by his side until they arrived at a tea-shop. But there he
paused. "Really, I couldn't look at food this morning," he said.</p>

<p>Kenly saw that he was speaking the truth; the man's
shaking hands told their own tale.</p>

<p>"After you've had a pick-me-up, you will be able to
look your grub in the face," he remarked.</p>

<p>He marched his man off to a chemist's shop, ordered
the draught, saw that his patient swallowed it to the last
drop, and brought him back again to the tea-shop. He
was quite ready for his own breakfast by this time, and
he brought a healthy appetite to the demolition of the
eggs and bacon which he ordered. Under, also, after he
had swallowed a couple of cups of tea, found that his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
appetite had returned. He was morally and physically
a better man when the meal was done.</p>

<p>But while it was in progress they talked, or, at least,
Kenly asked questions and Under answered them. The
detective learned a great deal during that conversation
of Guy's habits and of Guy's friends. There was ample
justification to his mind for the ruse he had employed,
when he heard the one fact that Guy was a frequent
visitor at the house of the Marvens. To his mind it
seemed that the threads which he held in his hand were
unravelling themselves. He was compelled to listen to
a full account of the eventful evening which had led up
to Under's dismissal. Though amused, he was not particularly
attentive until the valet mentioned the name of
his companion. When he heard that Cornelius Jessel
had been the tempter, he could barely restrain his eagerness
to obtain full particulars. Under was wax in his
hands. Kenly learned everything that the valet could
tell him of the companion of that disastrous evening.
He made no comment. The threads which seemed almost
to be coming loose had of a sudden twisted themselves
into an inextricable knot. He took leave of Under
shortly afterwards, and as he walked away he muttered
to himself, "By Henry! if I can make head or tail
of the confounded affair."</p>

<p>Still, he had learned enough to know that Lynton
Hora and Guy Hora and Cornelius Jessel were all in
some way concerned. Moreover, he began to suspect
that a possibility which he had eliminated from his reckoning
was within the bounds of credibility. He began
to see that his enquiries must include the goings and
the comings and the doings of Captain Marven.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI<br>
<small>GUY MAKES A RESOLUTION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>The dog days had come and the season was almost moribund when
Captain and Mrs. Marven and Miss Challys left town for their country
house in Essex, where Guy was to join them a week later, for he had
definitely accepted the invitation which had been pressed upon him.</p>

<p>London seemed empty to Guy with their departure. He had made it his
business in life to meet Meriel, and latterly not a day had passed
without his seeing something of her. If he had not met her with Mrs.
Marven at Raneleigh or Hurlingham or in the Park, he had been certain
to run against Captain Marven in the club, and he had never refused the
Captain's invitation to walk home with him for a cup of tea. At the
opera, at dances, there had always been the chance of meeting the girl
again, and chance had rarely proved unkind.</p>

<p>But he was not at all easy in his mind. The thought that he had
been accepting the hospitality and the friendship of the man whom he
had robbed of his trust, the man whose hand was given him in honest
friendship, ever haunted him. Yet the desire to be with Meriel at
all hazards overpowered his scruples. He made excuses for himself at
first, and, when he perceived that he was trying to cheat himself, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
half-formed resolution arose in his mind to so order his life in future
as to square it with Meriel's ideals. He realised that it would not be
difficult for him to do so, that a life of conventional morality meant
a life of ease, as compared with an existence ordered on the lines
of Hora's criminal philosophy. He told himself that his father would
appreciate his motives, and, though he might sneer at his decision, yet
would accept it. He even persuaded himself that the Commandatore must
have intended to suggest that he should break away from the old life
when he had persuaded him to take chambers of his own. Yet, though he
thus argued with himself, he did not go to Westminster Mansions.</p>

<p>There was another reason for remaining away. The last sentence in
the note which Cornelius Jessel had brought him and which had resulted
in the immediate establishment of the shadow now under his own roof,
had suggested a new idea to him.</p>

<p>"Myra is crying her eyes out at your absence," the Commandatore
had written, and the written words had made him think of Myra in a
new light. Myra was not his sister. Sisters did not cry their eyes
out at their brothers' absence. Could it be that she cared for him in
anything but sisterly fashion? The train of thought once started made
him reflect. He could see now that Myra's demeanour had been different
to him in a hundred little particulars during the past few months.
The frank sisterly attitude of her early years had been replaced by
something entirely different. When they had been boy and girl together
she had been free as the day with him. A girl of moods, subject to
hurtling gusts of passion which would pass as swiftly as they came,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
she had been prone to quarrel with him on the slightest pretext, and
as easily to forget the cause of her grievance. But of lateâ€”for quite
a year pastâ€”the attitude of the woman had materially altered from that
of the girl. Guy remembered, when he came to reflect, that he had quite
ceased to be the objective of any of her explosions of passion, that
she had been almost humbly solicitous of his welfare, his comfort, his
safety. He remembered her distress when Hora had broached the question
of his residing in chambers, her troubled demeanour when any new
adventure was projected. He had thought little of these things at the
time, but in the clearer vision which was vouchsafed to him through the
medium of his own feeling towards Meriel, he began to suspect something
of the truth. He had never thought of Myra in the light of anything but
a sister. Hardly that even, for Hora had not left him in ignorance of
her parentage, and of later years his thought of her had been rather as
of a good comrade, trained like himself to wage war with the world. But
if she should have learned to care for him, as he had learned to care
for Meriel! No, that would be impossible. He put the thought from him.
But it recurred. It was the second good reason which kept him away from
Westminster Mansions.</p>

<p>He was glad when his week of solitude was over, for
a London which did not contain Meriel was an absolute
wilderness, peopled only with meaningless shadows.
The week had seemed a month, more, a year. But it
passed, and the day dawned at last which was to bring
them together again under the same roof. The mere
contemplation of sleeping beneath the same roof set
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
Guy's blood tingling in his veins. He awoke gay and
bright. For a while he would put away all harassing
thoughts of the future, and drink of the cup of happiness
held to his lips.</p>

<p>Even as he lifted the cup, Hora, though absent,
dropped a leaf of rue therein which destroyed its sweetness.</p>

<p>Amongst his letters that morning was one from the Commandatore. "You
have not been to see us," he wrote, "and Myra is almost in despair. I
tell her that youth has its distractions which momentarily make one
forgetful of old ties and obligations. She seems to have some sort
of fancy that a feminine distraction may be the explanation of your
long absence, and is jealous of the unknown, an unphilosophic attitude
of mind with which the mere male cannot possibly cope. She cannot be
made to understand that pleasure is evanescent, and that satiety is
<i>avant courier</i> to philosophy. I am not surprised that you find
your hands full; indeed, I am glad to think that you must be acquiring
a rich store of information which will be of the greatest service in
our future operations. <i>En passant</i>, if you see anything of mine
old enemy, do your best to cultivate the acquaintance. I have a scheme
in my mind which I think may enable me to pay my debt in full. But more
of that when we meet. I am in no hurry. Revenge is so sweet a morsel
that one rolls it on the tongue, instead of bolting it whole, so I'll
tell you about my idea when we return to town, for I am going to take
Myra away for a few days. She seems a little pale, and sea breezes with
companionship (of the other sex) is almost invariably a specific for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
sentimental malady. We go to Scarborough to-day, but we shall be back
in a fortnight. Let us see you immediately we return."</p>

<p>When Guy laid down the letter the sparkle had gone out of the
cup of his enjoyment. He did not conceive that the writer of the
letter had been fully conversant with all his plans. He credited
Hora with trusting him as fully as he trusted Hora. To imagine that
the Commandatore had set a spy upon his movements never entered into
his calculations. He had no suspicions that the obsequious Jessel
who waited upon him so attentively was other than he seemed. So,
in following the dictates of his heart, he felt that he was acting
treacherously to his father, while if he were to fulfil his father's
desires he would sink unutterably in his own estimation. Between what
he considered his duty and his inclination, his mind was in turmoil.</p>

<p>The thought of Meriel expecting him proved the dominant
factor in his ultimate decision. While hesitating
whether or no to telegraph an excuse for not keeping his
appointment, Jessel announced that he was going on
with the luggage. At that moment Guy formed the
resolution definitely and absolutely that he would have
done with the past.</p>

<p>The resolution strengthened on his journey. If Lynton
Hora could have known the effect his letter had produced
he might have hesitated before he posted it. But
he had only suspected some weakening of Guy's enthusiasm,
and he had thought that a reminder would be
quite sufficient to recall Guy's errant fancy. Perhaps
had he not trained Guy, for his own protection, to so
honest a conception of loyalty to his friends, the subtle
poison of his letter might have produced the effect he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
had intended. As it happened, the suggestion Hora
had desired to convey, that Meriel should be a temporary
distraction, to be tossed lightly aside when it suited his
purpose, never came home to Guy. The further suggestion,
that Myra was waiting and longing for him, did,
however, affect him unpleasantly, even though he could
truthfully declare that he had never given her reason to
imagine that his affection towards her was more than
brotherly.</p>

<p>The final suggestion that he should insinuate himself into the
confidence of the Marvens in order to minister to Hora's scheme of
revenge was, however, the culminating point. His whole nature revolted
at the thought. Though by his early training he saw nothing wrong in
preying upon the world, instinctively his mind rebelled at the idea of
victimising his friends. Though the world might dub him thiefâ€”he would
have shrugged his shoulders in amusement at the world's folly in doing
soâ€”yet his sense of honour was far keener than that of the majority
of those who would have thrown the epithet at him, Captain Marven,
henceforward, should be secure, so far as he was concerned. There was
no obligation upon him to take upon himself the burden of another
man's quarrel, even though that other man were his own father. The
philosophic Commandatore himself would necessarily admit the logic of
such a decision.</p>

<p>Busied with such thoughts, it seemed to Guy that he had hardly
entered the cab before it stopped at the railway station. He had no
intention of turning back. Jessel was awaiting him on the platform. He
saw his master into his seat and retired to another compartment, where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
he had reserved a corner seat for himself. Guy had given him no
instructions to proceed beyond the railway station, so Cornelius
decided that he might just as well take it for granted that he was to
accompany his master, particularly as Hora had impressed upon him the
necessity for obtaining exact information regarding Guy's relationship
with the members of the Marven household. Still busied with his train
of ideas, Guy did not bestow another thought upon his valet.</p>

<p>The train wandered but slowly onwards to its destination, far
too slowly for Guy's desires, but Whitsea was off the main route to
anywhere, and the railway service was the minimum which a sleepy-headed
management thought would serve the necessities of the situation. But
at last Guy knew that he was nearing his destination. The country
stretched out flat on either side of the railway track, unbroken for
miles. Through the open window of his compartment entered the cool
salt breath of the sea. On his right a gleam of silver shone amidst
the green and crimson carpet of the marsh lands. The silver streak
broadened. Now it bore a red-winged barge on its bosom, and there
came in view the white wings of a flight of small craft skimming upon
the water. Next appeared a cluster of red-tiled, red brick houses
shimmering in the heat. The train drew into a station, a porter roused
himself from his afternoon nap and strolled slowly down the platform
calling "Whitsea! Change here for Whitsea," in a melancholy sing-song.
Guy picked up his stick and alighted. Would Meriel come herself to
meet him? He had asked the question of himself a hundred times on the
journey, and a hundred times had told himself that he expected far too
much.</p>

<p>But Meriel was there, and the delight in his heart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
showed in his eyes as he went forward with outstretched
hand to welcome her. Her eyes dropped under his ardent
glance, and the colour flushed her cheek. Guy had
seen no one but Meriel. Another voice recalled his wandering
faculties.</p>

<p>"I am just as delighted to welcome you to Whitsea,
Mr. Hora, as Meriel can be."</p>

<p>It was Guy's turn to flush, as he half turned to meet
Mrs. Marven's kindly glance.</p>

<p>"I only saw Miss Challys," he remarked simply.</p>

<p>"That was quite obvious," replied Mrs. Marven, as she took Guy's
hand, "and I am inclined to think that if I had been in your place I
shouldn't have seen anyone else, either. She is a pretty picture, isn't
she?" There was a tender inflection in her voice which put Guy at his
ease.</p>

<p>"There can be no two opinions about that," he answered
heartily.</p>

<p>"Auntie would make me vain, if I were not so already," said the
girl demurely, as she thrust her arm in Mrs. Marven's. "If you'll just
tell the porter which is your luggage, he will see that it is sent on.
We are not more than half a mile from the station, and we thought you
would like to walk to the Hall."</p>

<p>"Nothing could suit me better," declared Guy.</p>

<p>They strolled along the platform talking. Guy's kit
bag and dressing case were tossed out on the platform,
and Jessel was already mounting guard over them. Guy
did not recognise his servant until he was close to him.
His surprise was apparent in the tone of his voice.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jessel!" he said. "What on earth are you
doing here?"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>The man touched his hat. "Beg your pardon, sir,"
he said. "Didn't you intend me to come? You said
nothing, so of courseâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Guy interrupted him. "I thought I had told you!
But it doesn't matter. Just see that the porter has my
luggage all right. You can get the next train back."</p>

<p>He turned away. Cornelius touched his hat. His
face expressed disappointment. Mrs. Marven observed
his fallen countenance and came to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I ought to have told you to bring your man with you," she remarked
to Guy, "and unless you have something you want him to do for you, you
had better let him come to the Hall. I know that the Captain's man will
be delighted that you have brought him, for I don't mind telling you
now, that he detests valeting anyone but his own master."</p>

<p>With a word of thanks Guy dismissed the subject
from his thoughts. He was supremely indifferent to
Jessel's presence. Meriel was beside him. Nothing else
mattered.

<small>STAR-DUST</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Whitsea lies on the estuary of one of those Essex rivers which flow
into the North Sea through a wilderness of shallows. The visitor who
goes to it expecting to find any one of the ordinary attractions of
the average seaside watering-place may make up his mind to be wofully
disappointed. But the visitor with a delight in the unconventional and
the unhackneyed need not fear boredom. The salt marshes which border
the river for miles have a wild beauty entirely their own. Flowers
grow there as if the sea were no enemy to them. Then the six miles of
sheltered water which lie between Whitsea and the sea give protection
from wild weather, which the yachtsman is not slow to appreciate. So
when the days begin to lengthen the Whitsea River begins to be alive
with sailing craft, and when the summer days really come, it has a
population which lives entirely upon the water.</p>

<p>At Whitsea the Hall was the most prominent residence, even as
Captain Marven was the most distinguished inhabitant. It was just a
simple, kindly English house, at one with its simple, kindly English
inhabitants. The life there was a revelation to Guy. Never before had
he known what it was to be an inmate of a pure unpretentious English
country home.</p>

<p>"You will find us dull, I am afraid," had been Mrs.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
Marven's warning when she had invited him, "for excepting some
sailing and later in the year a little rough shooting Whitsea has no
attractions."</p>

<p>Dull! Guy had never found a life so full. Every
moment of the day provided a new item of interest.</p>

<p>The house itself was a haven of peace. The long, low white stone
structure stood on a little knoll looking with all its many eyes in
the face of the southing sun. It was girt about with an old garden
where the scent of roses disputed with the perfume of carnations for
supremacy, a garden where tall white lilies stood sentinel over serried
ranks of sweet peas, and gazed down unmoved upon the riot of colours
that filled the borders. Beyond the garden a meadow dropped down into
the saltings, and beyond the saltings the sea wall kept the tides at
bay, and ever the sweet fresh breezes dinted the surface of the water
and lifted the petals of the roses and whispered stories of the ocean
in the ears of those who walked in the garden, tempting them to venture
forth in search of the places where they were born.</p>

<p>Daily two of the inmates of the Hall responded to the temptation.
Meriel loved the sea. Guy was equally fervent in his adoration, and
there, ever before them, was the means of gratifying their desires
in the shape of the graceful ten-ton cutter <i>Witch</i> lying at
her moorings opposite the house, or the rightly christened little
eighteen-footer <i>Dainty</i>, which ever seemed to chafe at the chain
which saved her from going adrift. Oftentimes Captain Marven made one
of the party, more occasionally Mrs. Marven accompanied them, but there
were occasions when Meriel and Guy found themselves alone. Then when
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
the breeze sang in Guy's ears, and the spray tasted salt on his lips,
he felt a mad impulse to sail on and on with his precious cargo right
away out of the old life into a totally new one.</p>

<p>The two young people were drawn very close together in those days.
Meriel took no pains to conceal the pleasure she found in Guy's
companionship. Guy made no effort to disguise the fact that life held
only one hope for him. If there was a doubt at the back of his mind
that the hope was foredoomed to be disappointed, he put it away. He
would be happy while he might. Sorrow was for the sad days of autumn.
There was only one jarring note in the symphony. It was a trifling one
and did not affect Meriel. On the first day they went for a sail they
passed an excellently appointed steam yacht lying at anchor in the
fairway of the river. A figure immaculately clad in blue jacket and
white flannels raised a bridge-cap as they passed.</p>

<p>"Hildebrand Flurscheim, by all that's holy," remarked
Guy.</p>

<p>"Still searching for his missing pictures," said Meriel
laughing.</p>

<p>The thought was an unpleasant one. But Guy was not allowed to forget
it. Flurscheim found out that the Marvens were at their house and he
called, and, undeterred by a cool reception, called again. Guy could
not help but realise that if his host and hostess had been aware that
he was the burglar who had raided the connoisseur's treasure-house, the
coolness accorded Flurscheim would be nothing to the reception he might
expect.</p>

<p>But Captain and Mrs. Marven would have both been
horrified at the mere suggestion that Guy could be guilty
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
of such a deed. They were fully cognisant of the love-story developing
under their eyes, acquiescing smilingly. They anticipated an idyll.
They had watched Guy carefully, and they had seen no fault in him. He
had an unblemished university career and was apparently sufficiently
endowed with this world's goods. He seemed chivalrous, honourable, and,
above all, deeply in love. Thinking of the days of their own wooing,
they anticipated a happy union.</p>

<p>A week passed, the second week was near its end, when a shadow
was cast on the sunlight of Guy's happiness, and again the gloom was
produced by a letter from Hora, forwarded to him from his chambers.</p>

<p>"We shall be home on the Monday," wrote the Commandatore. "Please
come and see me on the Tuesday at latest, for I have now completed my
plans, and nothing remains but to put them into execution. Again let
me remind you to do your best to cultivate the Marven people, if the
opportunity arises. Any knowledge you may acquire concerning them is
likely to prove useful."</p>

<p>Guy took the letter with him into the open, where he
tore it into tiny fragments and scattered them to the
breeze. Cornelius Jessel from Guy's bedroom window
watched the flying fragments longingly. So also did
another man who, seated on the sea wall some hundred
yards away, was just near enough to realise what Guy
was doing. But neither Cornelius nor the stranger
made any efforts to recover the fragments. Detective
Inspector Kenly had no desire to call attention in so
pointed a fashion to the fact that he was visiting Whitsea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>Guy was unaware of the dual observation, even as Jessel was
unaware that his late landlord was so near to him. His action was
merely prompted by an outbreak of anger at the despicable part he was
expected to play. He did not at first remember that he had not told
the Commandatore of his projected visit. His anger passed, for he
thought that the expectation was founded on a misapprehension. But the
reiteration of Hora's intention, his renewal of the belief that he,
Guy, would be as ready as heretofore to participate in the carrying
out of his plans warned Guy that he must no longer delay coming to an
explanation with the Commandatore. Hora had named a date. That date
would suit Guy as well as another. It would not be fair to his father
to delay any longer.</p>

<p>Guy was unusually silent that morning, and when
Meriel joined him she was surprised that he should be
so preoccupied. She feared to rally him on the subject,
for she suspected a reason for his preoccupation which
she would not name to herself.</p>

<p>They went aboard the <i>Witch</i> about nine o'clock. There was a
fair wind from the north, the tide had just begun to ebb and there was
every promise of an ideal day. Gradually Guy's preoccupation melted
away. It was impossible to remain preoccupied on a brilliant summer
morning in Meriel's presence. By the time they had cast off their
moorings he was chattering away freely as ever. Hora was forgotten for
a while. He was remembered later.</p>

<p>"I must be going back to town on Tuesday," Guy
said in reply to a suggestion of some proposed trip for
the ensuing week.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>"Going back to town," remarked Meriel. There was
more than surprise, there was regret in her tone.</p>

<p>"I shall hate to do so," said Guy, "but I had a letter
from my father this morning and he particularly wishes
to see me."</p>

<p>Guy's voice had unconsciously hardened as he spoke.
His brow was knitted and his lips were compressed. He
looked up and he caught sight of a something in her
eyes which chased away the frown.</p>

<p>"Of course, you must go then," said Meriel.</p>

<p>Guy responded to the regretful note in the girl's voice.</p>

<p>"You will be sorry to lose me?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>The ghost of a blush fluttered for a moment on her
cheeks.</p>

<p>"We shall all be very sorry," she answered equivocally. Guy was
about to press the personal question home, but the sails shivered.
Meriel glanced upward. "Give me the tiller," she said. "You are
steering awfully badly this morning. Why, you've let the <i>Witch</i>
run right up into the wind."</p>

<p>Guy laughed as he vacated his post at the helm. For
the moment he was satisfied. He had seen an answer in
Meriel's eyes to his unspoken question which set his
mind at rest. Before the day was out that question
should be answered, but the time was not yet.</p>

<p>The <i>Witch</i> flew along, bending over to the breeze. The river
widened and the banks fell away. The cutter begun to curtsey to the
waves, and now and again a spatter of spray was tossed high in the air.
Guy took the tiller again and Meriel unpacked the luncheon basket. With
appetites sharpened by the breeze they picnicked on deck. They still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
pressed onward until the houses on the white cliff before them begun to
be plainly visible. Meriel looked at her watch.</p>

<p>"We are very near Clacton, and it is two o'clock," she
remarked. "Isn't it time we thought about returning?"
she added regretfully.</p>

<p>The summer breeze began to show a disposition to
change, veering to the east. Guy put the helm down
and went about. The wind veered still more, though it
still held. Guy gave the mainsail more sheet, and the
<i>Witch</i> ran merrily before the breeze over the slackening
tide. An hour passed and the wind became perceptibly
lighter. The afternoon sun shone down from a cloudless
sky, while a purple heat haze gathered on the horizon.</p>

<p>"Luckily we turned back when we did," said Meriel.
"We shall hardly get home on the tide even now.
Hadn't we better set the spinnaker?"</p>

<p>Guy acceded to the request. The breeze freshened
again, and for another hour the water rippled musically
under their bows. Then the breeze died away completely.</p>

<p>Guy shrugged his shoulders. "There's nothing for it
but a policy of masterly inaction," he said. "Don't you
think it is time for a cup of tea?"</p>

<p>He relinquished the tiller to his companion and dived
below to light the stove, and place the kettle upon it.
By the time the kettle boiled an absolute calm had
fallen, the sea might have served as a mirror, the sails
hung straight and still, the heat had become almost oppressive.</p>

<p>Neither Meriel nor Guy were troubled. They were together, and
although the boat seemed motionless they were drifting homewards. Guy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
especially was in no anxiety to return. Tea drunk and the cups
washed and put away, Guy brought cushions from the cabin and made a
comfortable couch on deck for Meriel, while he sat by the helm looking
down upon her.</p>

<p>Their talk became personal. Meriel's confidences were those of a
pure-hearted girl, and Guy, listening, longed to repay confidence with
confidence. If he only dared! But his risks were too great. How could
this pure girl be brought to comprehend his point of view? Yet he knew
that some day he must make the effort. Perhaps if she cared enough for
him she might strive to understand. If she cared enough! Yes, that was
the whole question. Her views were so totally opposed to those which
he had imbibed from his earliest youth, those which he knew now to be
hopelessly wrongâ€”not through any intellectual conviction, but merely by
his intuition of what would be his companion's attitude towards them.
He would make her understand how he came to have held such views and
where they had led him. But not if she did not care. He could not win
her under false pretences. She must know all about him, exactly what
he was, the hidden life which none save Lynton Hora and Myra knew. Yet
first he must know if she did care for him, otherwise such confidence
would be treachery to Hora. His thoughts constrained him to silence.
When his replies became monosyllabic Meriel looking up saw that his
countenance had become overcast. She, too, became silent.</p>

<p>The boat drifted.</p>

<p>Meriel lay back on the cushions. Her eyes half-closed.
She wondered what thought could be troubling her
companion. She glanced up again and met his eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>"Something is troubling you," she demanded suddenly.</p>

<p>"Yes, something is troubling me," answered Guy
moodily. With an impulsive gesture the girl held out
her hand. Guy grasped it. The little sunbrowned hand
was not withdrawn.</p>

<p>"Can I help?" she asked quietly.</p>

<p>"I cannot tell," he replied. "Untilâ€”â€”" The moment
had arrived when he felt that he must give utterance
to his thoughts or remain forever silent. He braced
himself to the effort. His voice was almost harsh.</p>

<p>"Meriel," he said. She started at the sound of her
name on his lips. "Merielâ€”â€”" He paused.</p>

<p>There was no coquetry in her nature. She understood
the unspoken thought as clearly as if it had been
vocalised in a flood of eloquence.</p>

<p>"Guy," she answered shyly.</p>

<p>The one musical syllable was sufficient. Their glances
met. Each read in the other's eyes the words they
longed to hear. Lips closed on lips.</p>

<p>The sun shone down fiercely. The boat drifted.</p>

<p>"Then you do care for me?" Guy asked presently.</p>

<p>"Do I care?" Meriel looked happily into his face.
"If anyone were to tell you that the sea had become dry
you might sooner believe the tale than that I should
have ceased to care for you."</p>

<p>"That is love," said Guy. "I know, for my love for
you is also greater than the ocean."</p>

<p>She was seated beside him. One hand was on the tiller, the other
encircled her waist and she leaned her head on his shoulder with a sigh
of content. The westering sun was dropping to the horizon, and on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
path of gold it painted on the waters the boat still drifted. Was this
to be the omen of their future lot? In his rapture Guy thrust away all
disturbing memories. He loved and he was beloved. Nothing could alter
that one fact. The whole world was transformed for him. The sun dropped
lower still. A rosy flush crept into the sky. The sea, unflecked by a
single ripple, glowed with opal fires. Nothing broke the stillness.
Meriel, too, lived her brief hour in love's fairyland.</p>

<p>The boat still drifted. The mouth of the Whitsea
River was narrowing in upon them. The sea wall stood
up blackly against the pellucid sky. The sun went down
behind the purple bank of mist. The colours faded. The
sweet grey calm of summer twilight spread its mantle
over the water. From somewhere on the shore a sandpiper
called to his mate.</p>

<p>Meriel awoke to reality with a start.</p>

<p>"We shall never make our moorings to-night, Guy,"
she cried. "It must be eight o'clock, and we are quite
four miles from home."</p>

<p>"I should be quite content, dear," he answered, "to
drift along forever."</p>

<p>"You would tell another tale when you came to examine
our store of provisions," she answered merrily.</p>

<p>Guy looked at his watch. "The tide will run for
another half hour," he said. "No, unless a breeze
should spring up the <i>Witch</i> will never make Whitsea
to-night."</p>

<p>"We shall have to leave her," answered Meriel
promptly.</p>

<p>"Why not wait for the next tide?" urged Guy.</p>

<p>"No, Auntie will be so anxious," the girl replied. "If
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
we drop anchor here and stow away comfortably we can
easily row home in the dingey."</p>

<p>Guy stood up and glanced around the horizon. The
air was perfectly still. There was not a movement in the
sails.</p>

<p>"We'll let her drift so long as the tide makes, and meanwhile
I'll make things snug," said Guy. The blocks creaked musically as he
gathered in foresail and jib. The topsail fluttered to the deck. It was
warmer work getting in the mainsail and darkness was gathering rapidly.
But the canvas was stowed away at last, the halliards made fast, every
rope coiled away in its place.</p>

<p>"The tide is on the turn," said Meriel. "If we can
edge in a little nearer the south shore the <i>Witch</i> will lie
as safely as she would on her moorings."</p>

<p>Guy hauled up the chain and cast the anchor loose.
"When you are ready, dear," he said.</p>

<p>"You may let go," she cried a minute later. The
anchor dropped with a heavy splash and the rattle of the
chain as Guy paid it out seemed almost a desecration of
the silence. When the anchor held, Guy once more went
below to trim and light the riding lamp. By the time his
job was finished and the lamp was swung, the sky had
gained a deeper tint of blue and the stars had begun to
sparkle. He drew the dingey alongside and held out his
hand to Meriel.</p>

<p>"You must let me take one oar," she said as she
stepped into the boat. "It will be a stiff pull against the
tide."</p>

<p>"When I am tired I'll tell you," he answered.
He looked regretfully at the cutter as he dipped his
oars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>"It seems ungracious to leave her," he said, "since
the happiest moments of my life have been passed aboard
her."</p>

<p>"Good old <i>Witch</i>," replied Meriel softly.</p>

<p>Night's mantle of darkness and silence enwrapped
them. The stars studded the moonless sky, the plunk
of the oars in the rowlocks and the drip of the water
from the blades alone disturbed the perfect stillness.
The boat drove onwards, leaving a trail of light in its
wake. The darkness had made yet another of nature's
marvels manifest. The water was full of phosphorescent
light. Guy rested on his oars. Meriel lifted a handful
of water and poured it back into the sea. It was as if
she had poured out a handful of gems. She threw a
handful of the diamonds in the air, and every gem as it
fell again into the water struck gleams of light from the
surface. They leaned over the side of the boat, and here
and there in the blackness the lights sparkled for a moment
and were hidden again.</p>

<p>"The water is full of star-dust," said Meriel. "See!"
she added eagerly. Guy followed the direction of her
outstretched finger.</p>

<p>A phantom form lighting its way beneath the surface
sailed by, a myriad of the sparkling points accompanying
it.</p>

<p>"Even the sea has its spirits," she remarked.</p>

<p>"On a night like this it is possible to idealise even a
jelly fish," he answered whimsically.</p>

<p>He took again to the oars. Few words were spoken
between them.</p>

<p>They came at last to their landing place. Guy made
the boat fast and joined Meriel on the bank. He clasped
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
her lightly in his arms. "Tell me you love me, Meriel,"
he demanded almost fiercely.</p>

<p>Her assurance was whispered only, but Guy recognised
an intensity as great as his own. He held her
closely to him.</p>

<p>"I have something toâ€”say," he told her. "I cannot ask you to marry
me,"â€”the words were wrung from himâ€”"until I have told you something
about myself which you do not suspect."</p>

<p>She did not move in his embrace. He could see her
eyes shining in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Nothing you could tell me would make any difference,
Guy," she answered.</p>

<p>A sharp pain stabbed his heart. "I am not worthy,
Meriel," he said. "And I fear that to-morrow you
will tell me so."</p>

<p>"As if it were possible," she answered.</p>

<p>"I have been very happy to-day," he continued. "Such
happiness cannot last. When you know what I am in
reality you will be glad to forget me."</p>

<p>This was more than the detraction of the ardent lover. Meriel
realised that there was the note of real suffering in his voice. She
waited almost with dread for him to continue. And Guy was upon the
point of pouring out his whole story. But the chance passed. A voice
hailed them from the lawn of the Hall.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Meriel?"</p>

<p>"Auntie is watching for our return," she said shyly.
"Come."</p>

<p>Guy followed her along the path to the house.</p>

<p>"To-morrow," he said and she understood.

<small>CORNELIUS JESSEL DREAMS OF A FORTUNE</small>
</h2></div>

<p>The morning was heavy with an almost unnatural calm. By nine o'clock
the sun's rays glowed with the intensity of noon. The flowers drooped
their heads and the leaves hung listlessly. Cornelius Jessel, passing
out of the back way from the Hall, on his way to the postoffice, had
not covered a dozen yards before he paused to mop his brow with his
handkerchief. He bore with him the letter in which Guy announced to
Hora his intention of returning to town. It was the briefest of notes,
disclosing nothing of the intention of the writer. But it was not the
only letter which Jessel carried. In the other envelope was the report
which the shadow man had penned to the Master. The envelope was stamped
and sealed, but Cornelius took it from his pocket and looked at it
and frowned. He replaced it in his pocket and proceeded on his way.
He did not know whether to post it or not. For the first time since
he had undertaken the part of spy upon Guy's actions he had wilfully
suppressed an item of information which had come into his possession
concerning Guy. It was such an important item of information, too.
So important that he had gasped for breath when he realised what the
discovery he had made really meant.</p>

<p>On the previous afternoon and evening he had taken advantage of
Guy's absence to make a careful examination of his master's property.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
He had frequently done so before, but without discovering anything of
any interest. But on this occasion he was more fortunate. He had long
been curious concerning the contents of a little silver-bound box which
reposed in a corner of Guy's dressing case. He had oftentimes made
discreet attempts to pick the lock but without success, and he dared
not venture on forcing it lest by damaging the box he should excite
suspicion. He guessed that sooner or later he would get the opportunity
he desired for examining the contents of the little casket, and the
occasion had arrived at last. Guy had left his keys on the dressing
table and one of the bunch fitted the lock.</p>

<p>When the lid was opened, Cornelius, at first sight of its contents,
gave a sniff indicative of disgust. He saw a little lace handkerchief,
a glove, an opera programme, a few withered rose leaves, and an
infinite contempt for the young man he served swept over him. There was
no trace of sentiment hidden away in the heart of Cornelius. But when
he tossed the trumpery aside he drew a long breath of surprise. Beneath
the valueless trifles was concealed an article of priceâ€”a little golden
frame enclosing an exquisite miniature on ivory of a girl with a wealth
of fair hair, the painting surrounded with a circlet of brilliants. At
first he did not grasp the significance of the discovery. The likeness
of the miniature to Meriel Challys seemed to him a full explanation as
to why it should be in his employer's possession. But as he turned the
frame over in his hand, counting the stones in the setting, weighing
the trinket delicately on two fingers to estimate the weight of the
gold, he remembered that somewhere he had seen a description of some
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
such article. Where? He had not to rack his brain very long before he
was able to recall where he had seen the miniature described. Like many
another person who longs for the prize without incurring the attendant
risks, Cornelius had assimilated every detail which had been made
public concerning the Flurscheim robbery. His mouth had watered at the
published descriptions of the stolen articles and now hereâ€”if he was
not greatly mistakenâ€”was one of them in his own hand.</p>

<p>At the heels of this thought came another which almost made his
heart cease beating. Five thousand pounds reward! Five thousand
pounds had been offered for such information as would lead to the
conviction of the thief and to the recovery of the stolen property.
Fiveâ€”thousandâ€”pounds! Five thousand pounds was lying waiting for
him, Cornelius Jessel. Yet, dazzled as he was by the prospect of the
acquisition of such wealth, he hesitated a long while before he could
persuade himself to make use of the information which had come into
his possession. It was the thought of the Master which gave him pause.
In view of the discovery which he had made he began to be timorous.
He could no longer believe that the Master's interest in Guy Hora was
the interest of the hawk in the pigeon. Dimly he began to comprehend
that unknowingly he was being used as pawn in a game which he did not
comprehend. Supposing then that any effort of his own to secure that
five thousand pounds should run counter to any plan of the Master's? He
shivered at the thought, for he had a very real fear of the Master's
capacity for mischief. He had locked the miniature and the glove and
the rose leaves away again and set his wits to work to discover a plan
by which he might obtain the five thousand pounds without the fact that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
he was the informer being disclosed to anybody. The more he pondered
upon the subject the more convinced he became that fortune was within
his grasp. He could not have made the discovery at a more opportune
moment. He was in the country surrounded by a lot of simple country
folk, and within reach was the victim of the burglary, who had offered
the reward. What better plan could be conceived than that of taking
his information straight to the fountain head? He would then be able
to make his own terms. But he saw that it would be necessary to have
some proof of the correctness of his statements. He paid another visit
to Guy's dressing case after providing himself with a pencil and oiled
paper. With these he made a series of tracings of the miniature,
and, clumsy as they were, yet he trusted that they might be clear
enough for identification. Thus provided, he determined to take the
first opportunity afforded him of communicating with Mr. Hildebrand
Flurscheim.</p>

<p>The determination carried with it as a necessary corollary the
decision to keep his discovery concealed from everybody, particularly
from the Master. He would have felt quite easy in his mind if he could
have assured himself that the Master was not already acquainted with
the fact that Guy possessed the miniature. On the other hand, Cornelius
argued that it was quite possible that the man who was paying him to
keep a watch upon Guy might be actuated by dread of a confederate
playing him false. That was a strong reason why he should not postpone
communicating with Flurscheim. The reward would go to the first in the
field with the information. Then if the Master were implicated, and if
he should be captured, Cornelius saw safety for himself. Therefore
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
when he wrote his daily report to the Master of Guy's movements he
entirely omitted to mention the momentous discovery he had made, and
yet so terrified was he that he should bring his employer's vengeance
upon himself by his failure to report it, that a dozen times on the way
to the postoffice he drew the letter from his pocket and looked at it
and considered whether he should not reopen the envelope and add the
information which he had suppressed.</p>

<p>Even when he had dropped the letter into the box he nearly entered
the postoffice to ask for it back again, and only prevented himself
from doing so by declaring to himself that it would be easy to give the
information thereafter if circumstances pointed to the desirability
of his doing so. But once the letter was posted Cornelius became
bolder. The posting of the letter was in the nature of a definite
act committing him to a definite policy. It was no use looking back,
especially with the prospect of five thousand pounds to be earned by
merely speaking a few words. He forgot the heat. He walked briskly away
from the postoffice towards the little embankment which Whitsea village
proudly designated "The Front."</p>

<p>It seemed hotter than ever there. The tide was low and the air
shimmered in the heat reflected from the silvery banks of mud. He
placed his hand on the stone parapet of the low wall and drew it back
hastily. The stone was nearly hot enough to have blistered his hand.
He looked out on the river. Almost opposite him was Mr. Hildebrand
Flurscheim's yacht, and if Cornelius's eyes were to be trusted Mr.
Hildebrand Flurscheim himself was reclining beneath an awning on the
deck. The opportunity was too good to be missed. Cornelius looked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
around for a boatman to put him aboard. There was none visible, and he
could not muster up courage to hail the yacht. The Whitsea hotel showed
an inviting open door just handy. Cornelius felt suddenly thirsty.
He accepted the invitation of the open door, and while he quenched
his thirst with a bottle of iced ginger beer with something in it, he
made known his desire to be put aboard Mr. Flurscheim's yacht to the
barmaid.</p>

<p>Before the words were well out of his mouth a man
who had followed Cornelius into the hotel remarked,
"I'll put you aboard the boat with pleasure, Mr. Jessel."</p>

<p>Jessel's first impulse was to fly. To be suddenly accosted by name
when so far as he knew there was no one in Whitsea except the servants
at the Hall who could be aware of his identity, was disconcerting to
say the least. He stifled the impulse as best he could, and, turning on
his heel, faced the speaker. He saw a pleasant, open-faced man of fifty
or thereabouts holding out his hand.</p>

<p>"Didn't expect to see me here, eh, any more than I
expected to have the pleasure of meeting you? But the
world's a little place, and this sort of weather, if one is
likely to knock up against old acquaintances, there's no
spot more likely than where you find a pretty girl mixing
long drinks with a lot of ice in 'em. That's right,
isn't it, miss?"</p>

<p>The barmaid giggled.</p>

<p>"A slice of lemon, a bottle of Schweppe, a lump of
ice, and a suspicion of white satin, if you please," he
said before turning again to Jessel and continuing volubly.
"You don't recognise me, eh? Well, I'm not surprised,
for now I come to think of it we haven't exchanged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
more than a dozen words in our lives. My
name's Kenly."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Cornelius remembered and immediately felt
easy in his mind. He had no reason for dreading his
late landlord. He took the proffered hand.</p>

<p>"This is a surprise," he said. "Who would ever have
expected to meet you here?"</p>

<p>"The same to you," said Kenly. He pointed to Jessel's glass. "Drink
up and have another and tell how you are getting on," he said. "The
missis will be pleased to hear, for she's always telling me that she's
never likely to have such a nice gent in the house to do for, and she's
always cracking on about your being obliged to leave, and how certain
she is never to get another like you."</p>

<p>Cornelius smiled and emptied his glass. "Well, as
you insistâ€”â€”" he said.</p>

<p>"Another of the same," said Kenly affably.</p>

<p>"And what brings you down here?" asked Cornelius.</p>

<p>"Taking my holiday," remarked Kenly expansively. "This is just the
sort of a place that suits me. No sand, no niggers. Plenty of fresh air
and sunshine, a boat to potter about in, and some of the real sort to
drink when you're thirsty, that's the place that suits me down to the
ground, so I'm here. I suppose you're down for a change, too?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied Cornelius. "I have to combine
business and pleasure, too." He took a long draught
of the fresh brew which the barmaid handed to him, and,
assuming his most important air, he changed the topic.</p>

<p>"I suppose Mrs. Kenly is with you?"</p>

<p>"Not much," answered the detective with a broad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
wink. "I know a bit too much to bring the missis on a
holiday, and, if you are married, you'd understand."</p>

<p>Cornelius laughed and glanced at the barmaid. "You
can't tell me anything," he said.</p>

<p>"No," answered Kenly. "Half the bachelors to-day
know more than the married people, and that's a fact,
ain't it, miss?"</p>

<p>The barmaid giggled again. "You're a caution," she said. The
conversation progressed swimmingly, and ten minutes later Cornelius
embarked on a dingey, having graciously allowed Kenly to put him aboard
Mr. Flurscheim's yacht. He lounged in the stern, assuming his most
important air, while Kenly pulled away at the oars. He was fully alive
to the fact that he would create a much better impression going aboard
thus than if he had been compelled to borrow a boat and pull himself
out to the yacht.</p>

<p>Kenly ran him up alongside, steadied the boat by the side of the
ladder, and then let his dingey drop astern to a sufficient distance to
allow him to observe Cornelius introduce himself to Flurscheim. He saw
that the two men were strangers, and he gathered that the connoisseur
was annoyed at Jessel's invasion of his privacy. He saw the connoisseur
jump up suddenly at something which was said and begin to pace the deck
in manifest agitation. He saw Jessel standing unmoved, and then after a
brief conference both men went down the companion into the saloon.</p>

<p>The detective immediately realised that there was a
chance of his learning what errand had taken Jessel to
the yacht. Half a dozen strokes took him alongside
again, and, making his painter fast to the yacht's anchor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
chain, he stood up in the dingey as it drifted level with an open
port. As he had suspected the porthole gave upon the saloon, and as
the dingey came opposite he could hear two voices in excited colloquy.
One was easily recognised as Jessel's, and the other Kenly had just as
little difficulty in recognising as Flurscheim's.</p>

<p>"Is that anything like the face on one of your miniatures?"
said Jessel.</p>

<p>"I could swear to it," said Flurscheim.</p>

<p>"And the portraitâ€”is it like anyone you know?"
asked the valet.</p>

<p>"You've seen it," cried the Jew eagerly. "You must
have done, for the miniature is so like Miss Challys
that she might have sat for the portrait."</p>

<p>"I have seen it and I can tell you where it is at the
present moment," answered the valet.</p>

<p>"Where? Where?" cried the Jew eagerly.</p>

<p>"You don't expect me to tell you straight away, do
you?" asked Jessel in an injured tone.</p>

<p>The Jew took no notice. "And the other boxes and
the picturesâ€”can you tell me where my Greuze is?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't, at least not at present," said the valet
coolly, "but I reckon that if once I put you on the track
of one of the things that has been stolen it won't be my
fault if you don't find out where the rest of 'em are."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Flurscheim, impatiently, "tell me
where the miniature is?"</p>

<p>There was silence and the detective listened impatiently.</p>

<p>"Have you lost your tongue?" demanded Flurscheim
angrily.</p>

<p>"What about the reward you offered?" said Jessel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
"Five thousand pounds, wasn't it, for such information
as shall lead to the conviction of the thieves or the recovery
of the stolen property?"</p>

<p>"You shall have the reward, all right," said Flurscheim
impatiently.</p>

<p>"I'm not misdoubting your word," said Jessel, "but
in cases like this it's better to 'ave everything in black
and white. 'Ave it in black and white, that's my motto."</p>

<p>Kenly heard the connoisseur give a grunt of disgust,
and he smiled. He could even hear the scratching of a
pen on paper. Then Flurscheim's voice remarked
sharply:</p>

<p>"Mind, I'll give nothing to any confederate in the robbery. If you
have had anything to do with it and will make a clean breast of the
matter, I'll do my best for you, but I'm not going to be blackmailed by
any dâ€”â€”d thief."</p>

<p>The detective smiled again at the injured tone of Jessel's reply.
"I'm a respectable man, Mr. Flurscheim, though I am a poor one, an' the
hinformation 'as come to me quite unexpected like. If I was rich I'd be
'appy to tell you all I know for the cause of justice, but being only
poor, I've my old age to think of."</p>

<p>"Well, I only warned you, that's all," grumbled Flurscheim.</p>

<p>"Which there was no need," answered Cornelius with
dignity. "And there's another matter," he added, and
now the detective could detect a note of anxiety in his
voice. "There's them as is connected with this job that
won't stick at nothing to get even with them as gives
'em away, if they has so much as a hint as to who done
it. You'll have to give me your word of honour as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
gentleman as you'll not so much as mention my name,
or my life'll not be worth two pennorth of gin."</p>

<p>This time Flurscheim was silent a while before he replied.</p>

<p>"If I don't know your name it is not possible for me
to mention it."</p>

<p>"You can easy find out," answered Jessel, "when I tell
you what I have to tell you."</p>

<p>"I promise," replied Flurscheim shortly.</p>

<p>Jessel dropped his voice, but, low as it was, the detective's keen
ears overheard every word of the information which was imparted. He was
thunderstruck at the intelligence that a part of the stolen property
was in the possession of Guy Hora. He could not conceive the motive
which had prompted Jessel to disclose the fact, even if it were true.
He wanted time to arrange his ideas on the subject. But he listened
eagerly to every word that passed. He missed not a word of the long
conversation that ensued when Jessel had imparted the information he
possessed. He drank in all Flurscheim's questions and all the valet's
answers, and was so anxious to lose nothing of what passed that he had
barely time to cast the boat loose and drift astern when he heard them
rise to leave the saloon. Still he presented a picture of perspiring
innocence when he pulled up alongside to take his late lodger back to
the quay.</p>

<p>Cornelius was obviously elated. "Sorry to 'ave kept
you so long, Kenly," he remarked. "But I 'ad to wait
for an answer to something. We must have another
drink."</p>

<p>They had it and the detective learned that Cornelius
was expecting to return to town the following day.

<small>INSPECTOR KENLY REPORTS</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Although Cornelius had been entirely unaware of the fact, his late
landlord had arrived at Whitsea by the same train as himself, and had
been keeping a sharp eye on him, and if it were possible, a still
sharper eye on Guy Hora. But Kenly's observation had been unproductive
until the time when he obeyed the impulse to make himself known to
Jessel. He had been impelled to do so by sheer desperation at having
passed, from a professional point of view, one of the most unprofitable
fortnights of his life. He had not anticipated any remarkable
revelations when he had followed Cornelius into the hotel bar, and when
he finally bade his old tenant good-bye, he had no need to force a
spice of heartiness into the greeting.</p>

<p>Directly after Jessel left him he felt the necessity for
rearranging all his theories, but at the same time he was
equally alive to the desirability of getting to work upon
the new clue which was in his possession. There was
now nothing to keep him in Whitsea. He had learned
of Guy's intention to return to London the following
day, and he determined to be in town before him. There
would be plenty of time to decide upon the best course
to pursue during the journey.</p>

<p>He went into the hotel, packed his bag, and paid his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
bill in a desperate hurry, for the hotel omnibus was at
the door.</p>

<p>He caught his train and was thankful to find so few people
travelling that he could get a compartment to himself. He could marshal
his ideas better in solitude. Still, arrange them and rearrange them
as he might, he could get no nearer a reasonable explanation of the
relationship of the various parties who had become objects of his
suspicion. The only theory which seemed at all tenable was that the
Horas, father and son, Cornelius Jessel and Captain Marven were all
members of a gang of criminals who operated in perfect safety by
reason of the social position of the principals. But in such case
Kenly could not understand the motive of the elaborate plot by means
of which Cornelius had secured for himself his place in Guy's service.
Nor could he comprehend why Captain Marven's name should have been
used in regard to the stock exchange operations which had followed
upon the acquisition of the knowledge contained in the despatches. To
Kenly, that seemed such a gratuitous piece of folly, as to be entirely
unworthy of the audacious person who had planned and carried out the
Flurscheim coup.</p>

<p>Like a wise man, he ceased after a while to trouble himself with
inventing explanations to fit theories. He knew very well that once all
the facts were in his hands an explanation would be easy to find, and
he was anxious to get some additional facts. Was not that the motive
which had made him decide to leave Whitsea in such a hurry? He knew
very well that Guy was not carrying the stolen picture about with him,
and he had learned quite enough about Whitsea Hall to be quite assured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
in his own mind that the picture was not likely to be reposing there.
He had, however, become sufficiently acquainted with Lynton Hora's
mode of life from his friend the hall porter of Westminster Mansions,
to warrant the assumption that the Greuze was hidden somewhere in
Lynton Hora's flat. If he could only get an opportunity to verify his
suspicion before any of the persons he suspected were alarmed, he saw
an opportunity of bringing off a coup which would provide a startling
denouement to the sensational Flurscheim burglary. The thought ran
away with him to such an extent that he allowed himself to taste the
sweets of success. He imagined himself reading the references in the
newspapers to "the smart work of that able officer, Detective Inspector
Kenly." He imagined himself listening to the commendations of the Judge
when the prisoners at the bar had been sentenced to various terms of
penal servitude, andâ€”â€” He awoke to the bustle of Liverpool Street
railway station, limp with perspiration, still undecided as to the best
manner of setting about getting the evidence he needed, and perforce
compelled to leave circumstances to guide his course of action.</p>

<p>He permitted himself the luxury of a cab to Scotland Yard, where he
proposed to deposit his bag and report himself. He had another reason
for calling at headquarters. He foresaw that very shortly the moment
might arrive when he would not be able to deal with the situation
single-handed. If all the parties whom he expected to be implicated
in the two affairs were to be kept under surveillance, he would need
assistance, and he was not quite certain whether that moment had not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
already arrived when some such steps were necessary. Then Mr.
Hildebrand Flurscheim might at any moment communicate with the Yard,
and Inspector Kenly did not want anyone else to be put on the job
without his knowledge. He knew that as he had previously had the
investigation in hand, if he reported himself back in town he would be
communicated with in the event of any fresh information coming to hand,
even though he was detailed for special service on the Foreign Office
affair, and thereby relieved of the obligation to render daily reports
of his work to his own department.</p>

<p>He was glad that he had determined to report himself,
for he found awaiting him a pressing message from the
Permanent Secretary, asking him to call at the Foreign
Office, as the Great Man was anxious to know the result
of his investigations.</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly looked at his watch. The afternoon was young. The
Permanent Secretary could be kept waiting for an hour or two longer.
The detective, leaving his bag behind him, strolled out into the
sun-scorched streets. He had even forgotten that he had eaten no lunch,
so eager was he on his quest. He walked briskly towards Westminster
Mansions, and could have shouted with delight when he observed his old
comrade standing at the open door. "Hello, looking for a breeze," he
remarked.</p>

<p>The porter chuckled.</p>

<p>"If you've been locking any up lately, the sooner you
let 'em loose again the better I shall be pleased," he remarked.</p>

<p>"It looks cooler inside than out here," said Kenly,
with meaning.</p>

<p>The porter winked and led the way inside. Two lift
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
attendants were seated languidly interesting themselves
in the cricket intelligence of the latest evening papers.</p>

<p>Kenly glanced at them while he asked in a low tone:
"Is there any chance of a private chat?"</p>

<p>His old comrade nodded, and after talking for a few
moments on the burning topic of the weather, managed
to send both the youths on an errand. Kenly grunted his
relief. Directly he was alone with the porter he went
straight to the point.</p>

<p>"I want to go over Mr. Lynton Hora's flat," he announced
abruptly.</p>

<p>The porter gazed at him in silent astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean exactly what I say," he continued, "and
the sooner I can do so the better I shall be pleased. I
suppose some of your people have a key?"</p>

<p>The hall porter regained his power of speech. "It
can't possibly be managed, Kenly," he spluttered.
"There's nothing I wouldn't do for you in reason,
butâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Kenly cut him short. "It's got to be done," he remarked
decisively. "I've come to you, because I know
I can trust you to say nothing, and the fewer people who
know what I am doing the better I shall be pleased."</p>

<p>"It can't be done," remarked the hall porter. "It
would be as much as my place is worth."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said the detective. "It is easy enough to
make some excuse. You can say I'm the electric light
man or that I have orders to clean out the cisterns."</p>

<p>"There ain't no cisterns that want cleaning," objected the hall
porter. "Now if you had come and asked me two days ago there wouldn't
have been any difficulty, but to-dayâ€”â€”"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>"Why is it impossible to-day?" demanded the detective.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Hora and Miss Myra have been away at
Scarborough for the past fortnight, and I could have let
you in to their place, but I'm expecting them to return
at any minute now."</p>

<p>"Then we mustn't lose any time talking about it,"
said Kenly briskly. "I suppose you have some means
of communicating with the flat from here."</p>

<p>"There's the telephone," said the porter.</p>

<p>"Take me straight up," said Kenly, "and if Mr. Hora should arrive
before I come down again just give two rings at the telephone bell.
I shall have plenty of time to let myself out before Mr. Hora
returns." He caught hold of the porter's arm and hurried him away in
the direction of the lift. Protesting all the while that it would
be impossible and entreating Kenly to postpone his visit to a more
convenient occasion, he yet allowed himself to be carried away by the
detective's impetuosity. He protested while the lift went steadily
upward, he protested even while he inserted a key in the lock, and
Kenly left him outside the door still protesting.</p>

<p>Fortune seemed to be favouring the detective. From previous
conversations he had gained a fairly accurate knowledge of the
geography of the interior of Hora's residence, and he wasted no time
in searching the residential portion of the flat. He went directly
to the door where Hora kept his pictures and his books. But here he
experienced a rebuff. The door was locked, and the lock was a patent
one. Kenly had with him a bunch of skeleton keys, but a very slight
trial proved that the lock was unpickable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span></p>

<p>He began to cast around for some other means of gaining access, but
he saw none within the flat. He passed through all the rooms, glancing
round each. He was impressed by the luxury of the furnishing, but
there was nothing which could cause anyone to suspect the occupant of
anything but highly refined tastes. Kenly had just completed his hasty
survey when the telephone bell rang twice.</p>

<p>"Dâ€”â€”n!" said the Inspector. He opened the outer door and walked out
into the passage outside. He knew that he must not be seen, and he
hastily descended the flight of stairs to the floor below, and as he
did so the lift passed him ascending upwards. He caught a glimpse of
Hora's face.</p>

<p>Kenly waited until the lift descended. The hall porter
himself was in charge. He stopped the lift. Kenly entered
in silence.</p>

<p>"Find what you wanted?" asked the porter curiously.</p>

<p>"No time," grunted the detective. "I must have a look round another
time. If I had only known yesterday what I learned to-dayâ€”â€”" He groaned
at the thought of what might be hidden beyond that locked door. Still
he was not disheartened. He had noted the number of the lock and the
name of the maker, and he knew that the next time he called the locked
door would prove no barrier to his investigations. Still, days might
pass before the opportunity he desired would recur, and it was annoying
to feel that opportunity had been lost by so narrow a margin. He bade
his friend good-bye and went away at once to the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>The sky had become overcast and the atmosphere was hotter than ever.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
Visions of a long drink, with cool translucent lumps of ice tinkling
against the steamy glass, sorely tempted the detective, but he banished
them, and, perspiring himself, he was at last ushered by a perspiring
attendant into the presence of a perspiring Permanent Secretary who
had wheeled his chair on to a line between the open door and the open
window, and sat there in his shirt sleeves in the pathetic belief that
a draught of cool air might be tempted to pass that way.</p>

<p>"What is it? What is it?" he snapped at the attendant
who entered to announce Inspector Kenly. Then
looking up he recognised his visitor standing at the open
door.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Kenly. Come in." The attendant withdrew.
"And, yes, you had better shut the door." He
sighed as if he had thereby ordered the door to be shut
on his own salvation.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Inspector, and tell me what you have found
out," he added.</p>

<p>He looked round for his cigar case, and not finding it
immediately made confusion of the pile of papers which
covered his table.</p>

<p>"I think, Sir Everard, you will find your cigar case
in your coat pocket," observed the detective blandly.</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary smiled as he thrust his hand
into the breast pocket of his discarded coat.</p>

<p>"The heat always makes me irritable," he apologised.
"No man ought to work when the thermometer reaches
the eighties." He selected a cigar. "By the way," he
remarked, "by what process of reasoning did you
arrive at the deduction that my cigar case was in my
pocket?"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>"I saw the corner of it sticking out," remarked the
detective equably.</p>

<p>"Hâ€”m," said the Permanent Secretary, laughing, "the
proper use of the eyes may on occasion be more valuable
than any amount of deduction."</p>

<p>He lit his cigar and stretched himself lazily in his
chair.</p>

<p>"Now fire away, Kenly. I can see that you have something
to tell me about those stolen despatches."</p>

<p>Without unnecessary beating about the bush Kenly
began the result of his investigations. The narration
did not take long, for, though he had already spent a
month on the investigation, the facts he had discovered
could be described in a very few words. But few as
those facts were they were sufficiently startling to make
the Permanent Secretary forget the heat.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" he remarked, when Kenly had finished.
"And I would have pledged my life on Captain Marven's
absolute honour. Yet, from what you have told
me, he appears to be hand-in-glove with a gang of
thieves, one of them living in his own house and likely
at any moment to become engaged to his daughter."</p>

<p>"Certainly appearances are very much against him," remarked Kenly
cautiously, "but I never trust to appearances myself. I have seen too
many cases, where perfectly innocent persons have been on the most
intimate terms with scoundrels, to allow that one fact to weigh with
me. If it was only a question of the burglary, I should expect Captain
Marven to be the next victim of the gang, and it is only the fact that
it seems impossible for the contents of the despatches to have become
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
known to the Horas without Marven's assistance which leads me to
suspect him with the rest of the crowd."</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary puffed meditatively at his
cigar.</p>

<p>"Things look very black against Marven," he said. "Very black
indeed," he repeated, after a lengthy pause; then he asked, "Who are
these Horas?" Kenly shook his head.</p>

<p>"I should like to know their history myself," he answered. "All I
have heard hitherto is that the elder man has occupied a first-class
flat in Westminster for the past ten years at a rent of three hundred
and fifty pounds a year, and passes as a very retired gentleman indeed.
He spends only about six months of the year in London, and they say he
has estates in Italy. That may or may not be the case, but, anyhow,
he calls himself the Commandatore, which I'm told is an Italian title
given him by the King of Italy for something or other he's done over
there. The young one was at Oxbridge and made quite a name amongst his
set, and lived at home till a few weeks ago, when he took some chambers
in the Albany. Then there's a girl named Myra, who passes as the old
man's daughter, though there's reason to think that she's only an
adopted child."</p>

<p>"What are you proposing to do?" asked the Permanent
Secretary, after another pause.</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly coughed. "That dependsâ€”â€”" he remarked, and paused.
"That depends on circumstances. You see, Sir Everard, my hand may be
forced before I shall have obtained all the evidence I want. That
communication which has been made to Mr. Flurscheim may lead at any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
moment to the younger Hora's arrest, and then good-bye to the hope of
obtaining any more evidence. What I was going to suggest was that you
should allow me to continue to investigate your affair. It will leave
me more free to look after things than if I have to turn in a report to
headquarters. I'm so afraid," he added in a burst of confidence, "that
they might put some man on to the job that would bungle it. I've got
an idea as to where the Greuze is hidden, but I know very well that
at the first hint of anything going wrong it would disappear, or be
destroyed."</p>

<p>"Then you think that the same people who brought
off the Flurscheim burglary are responsible for the despatch
leakage?" asked the Permanent Secretary.</p>

<p>"Certain of it," declared Inspector Kenly.</p>

<p>"But if you continue to work on my business, isn't
what you fear likely to come to pass? Will not another
man be put on to the picture robbery? Flurscheim will
hardly keep silence."</p>

<p>"I'll see after that," answered Kenly. "From what I
know of Mr. Flurscheim he won't let the grass grow
under his feet. He is probably on the way to town
now."</p>

<p>"Then what becomes of your plans?" asked the Permanent
Secretary. He could see that the detective had
not revealed all that was in his mind.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flurscheim wants to get his Greuze back undamaged," said the
detective slowly, "and he also wants to punish the man who stole it. I
shall see him directly he arrives in town, and I think I can make it
clear to him that he had better say nothing until I consider the time
ripe for action."</p>

<p>"There's only one thing more," remarked the Permanent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
Secretary. "Suppose I think it necessary to ask
Captain Marven for an explanation?"</p>

<p>The detective jumped to his feet with a look of horror
on his face. "Good heavens! Sir Everard," he exclaimed,
"you would spoil everything. You won't do
it?"</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary laughed.</p>

<p>"You may make your mind easy, Kenly," he observed.
"I'm too much of a sportsman for that, I hope."

<small>GUY'S LAST THEFT</small>
</h2></div>

<p>While Inspector Kenly was hastening to London events at Whitsea were
shaping themselves to the bewilderment of a number of the inhabitants
of that pleasant little yachting resort. There was electricity in the
air afflicting everyone with a vague disquietude. Meriel, thinking
over Guy's wild outburst after his passionate declaration of love,
felt a strange dread of what the day should bring forth. Guy, fearing
the result of the confession he had promised to make, could see no
sun behind the gathering clouds. Mrs. Marven, noticing a new-born
constraint between the two young people, began to think that she had
misread the signs which had seemed confidently to predict a love-match.
Captain Marven, less dubious on this point, felt only vaguely uneasy.
He therefore decided that the electricity was not produced by mental
disturbance, but was purely atmospheric.</p>

<p>"There is thunder in the air," he declared, and counselled the
members of his household not to get far away from home.</p>

<p>But on the physical horizon there was no cloud. Guy, wishing to
be alone once more with Meriel, proposed that they should bring the
<i>Witch</i> home, and Meriel, fearless of the sun and longing for an
end to her suspense, acceded to the suggestion.</p>

<p>After an early lunch they started. The heat was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
greater than ever, but Guy was heedless of it. He pulled
at the oars as if physical exertion was a panacea for a
troubled mind. Meriel, watching him from the stern
as the dingey cut the water, rejoiced in his strength. At
least her lover was a man.</p>

<p>She wondered greatly what was on his mind. She was no petticoated
ignoramus of the world. She knew that men were sometimes caught in
feminine entanglements, and were sometimes even ashamed of their folly.
It might be that Guy had been so caught, and felt in honour bound to
acquaint her with his difficulty. She did not want to hear. It was
quite sufficient that he should desire that she should know the worst
of him. When he spoke she would stop him. She was quite sure, even as
she had said on the previous evening, that nothing that had happened in
the past could make any difference.</p>

<p>The <i>Witch</i> rode to her anchor, with her stern pointing
to the sea, for the tide was still ebbing when they reached
her side.</p>

<p>Meriel felt Guy's hand tremble as it clasped hers to assist her
aboard. She knew that the time had come when Guy would speak. She could
have cried aloud to him to remain forever silent, for a fear came upon
her that it was no youthful indiscretion which her companion proposed
to reveal, but something vital to their joint happiness, something
searing to their love. She put the thought aside. Her love was her
life: more, for it would endure after life itself had departed.</p>

<p>"Are you listening, Meriel?" asked Guy a little later.</p>

<p>He had set the mainsail, and in the shadow it cast on
deck he had arranged cushions for her. She looked up
at him in mute answer.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span></p>

<p>"Meriel, don't look at me, your eyes will make a coward
of me," he said. "Look out on the horizon. Do
you see the white sail yonder? That boat is coming on
the first of the tide. By the time she reaches us you
will have no wish to look upon me again."</p>

<p>She denied the statement vehemently.</p>

<p>"I know what I have to tell you," he answered steadily.
"But first I should like you to know something of
the beliefs in which I was brought up."</p>

<p>He told her first of Lynton Hora's enmity with the
world, told her of his philosophy, of his conception of
mankind as a fortuitous aggregation of warring atoms,
each hypocritically desirous of concealing his real intent
from his neighbours.</p>

<p>"This I believed till I met you, Meriel," he said.</p>

<p>"But if that is allâ€”â€”" Her voice died away. Looking
at him, she saw his face had hardened.</p>

<p>"It is not all." He told her of his early training, of
the practical exposition of Hora's philosophy.</p>

<p>Meriel no longer looked at her companion's face. She
began to feel horror growing upon her. She gazed now
at the white sail. It was perceptibly nearer.</p>

<p>He carried the story of his life on to the point where he left the
University, told her how, merely in obedience to his father's advice,
he had not, during those days, practised the principles in which he had
believed. Hope began to grow again in her heart. She murmured, "Go on,"
eagerly.</p>

<p>He told her of his earnest desire to win the approbation of his
father, depicted for her the glamour which the adventurous aspect of
his profession presented. Abruptly he told her of his first enterprise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>Meriel's heart almost ceased to beat. The white sails
of the oncoming boat fascinated her. They were very
near now.</p>

<p>"That is not all, yet," he said. "There is one other
thing you must know." Paltering not at all, excusing
himself in no way, he told her the history of the stolen
despatches.</p>

<p>He had not looked at her at all during the narration,
but now he ventured one glance. Her face was unnaturally
pale.</p>

<p>"You know now why I could not ask you to marry me," he said. "I
cannot ask you to marry a thief. Yet, I want you to believe that, thief
though I am, I could not steal your love. You must believe that of me.
It is true." She heard him, but she made no answer. The boat she had
been watching had crept up until it was level. It passed. She shivered
in spite of the heat.</p>

<p>Guy had moved quietly away. She saw that the <i>Witch</i> had swung
on the tide. She watched him weigh the anchor and get the boat under
way with a curious fear in her heart; a fear for herself. In looks, in
bearing, in his manner, he was every inch a man, a man that she loved.
But he was a thief, the thief who had treacherously robbed the man who
had been a father to her, a thief for whom the police were searching, a
thief who might any day stand in the dock as a felon.</p>

<p>"Guy is a thief! a thief! a thief!" She had to repeat the words to
herself again and again lest she should forget. Yes, he had been quite
right, she could never marry a thief. She supposed that she ought to
be thankful to him for having told her before she had married him. She
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
would have married him if he had not told her. But he was wrong in
saying that he could not steal her love. He had stolen it. If she had
known from the first she would never have given her heart to him. But
he had come and taken it away, and now that he had given it back to
herâ€”â€”</p>

<p>Guy had come to the tiller. She roused herself and
looked into his face.</p>

<p>"It is not true that you did not steal my love," she
said. "You took my heart from me, and you have
broken it, and now you bring me back the pieces and
say you did not steal it." She spoke dispassionately, as
one who would argue the point.</p>

<p>Guy wondered at the tone until he saw the dazed look
in the girl's eyes.</p>

<p>"Meriel," he cried, "for God's sake don't look at me
like that. Say something, anything, if only it were to
curse me. I had to tell you, even though I knew that the
telling would end my life's happiness."</p>

<p>"I had no reason to think that you were anything but
an honourable man. I had never mixed with any but
honourable men, and so I suppose I was deceived," she
answered wearily. "I don't suppose I ought to blame
you."</p>

<p>She turned away, and going forward leaned upon the
staff-rack where she was hidden from his sight by the
intervening sail. Tears had come to her relief at last.</p>

<p>The boat drifted on with the tide. The sky was becoming
overcast and away in the north a heavy bunch
of clouds was gathering. A sudden breeze ruffled the
surface of the water, and died away as swiftly as it
arose. A puff filled the sails. It came from the south,
another puff followed it from another quarter, heading
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
the <i>Witch</i> so that the sails flapped wildly. Guy had
barely brought her up to the wind before it veered again
to the south. The <i>Witch</i> leaned over under the pressure,
and, gathering way, set the foam swirling under her
bows. As the squall strengthened the <i>Witch</i> began to
talk, and Guy cast an anxious look aloft. The squall
died away and once more the boat drifted. But the ten
minutes' breeze had brought them near home. They were
amongst the other boats moored in the river opposite the
quay.</p>

<p>Meriel had not moved from her place forward. Her tears had ceased
to flow. In a few more minutes she would have said good-bye to Guy
and to love. She looked up. The <i>Witch</i> was drifting past Mr.
Hildebrand Flurscheim's yacht, and the connoisseur was on the deck.
Meriel recognised him at the same moment that she was recognised. "Good
afternoon, Miss Challys. Look out for the storm, Mr. Hora," cried
Flurscheim.</p>

<p>Was there a spice of mockery in his voice, or was it her fancy?
Meriel could not be certain. There had been a smile on Flurscheim's
face. Supposing he suspected that Guy was the man who had robbed him
of his treasure, Guy would be arrested. She knew in that moment that
all that he had told her had made no difference to her affection. She
knew that she loved him, thief as he was, that she would do anything,
make any sacrifice, to rescue him from the result of his misdeeds. She
left her post and went aft to Guy's side. A distant flash of lightning
illuminated Flurscheim's face. He was still smiling as he gazed in
their direction. She wondered whether Guy had observed the Jew's
expression. If so, he had paid no heed to it. His whole attention was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
given to the boat, though now and again he cast an anxious glance at
the sky.</p>

<p>"Here comes the breeze again," he muttered. He gave a sigh of relief
as the sails filled. "Five minutes of it, and we shall escape the
storm," he said. The <i>Witch</i> heeled over till her rail was awash
and the foam creamed away in their wake.</p>

<p>Meriel looked back at Flurscheim. He waved his
hand, and even as he waved it he overbalanced and fell
forward into the water. She gave utterance to a sharp
cry of alarm.</p>

<p>"What is it?" shouted Guy, for the rushing of the
wind made ordinary speech impossible to be heard.</p>

<p>"Flurscheim is overboard," she gasped.</p>

<p>Without a moment's hesitation Guy put the tiller down,
and, as the <i>Witch</i> came up into the wind, he glanced in
the direction to which Meriel pointed. A dark object
was being borne swiftly along on the tide. Guy kept the
tiller down until the boat was before the wind, and
giving the mainsail more sheet, the <i>Witch</i> scudded back
in the direction she had come. But the dark object had
disappeared.</p>

<p>"Can you manage the tiller?" shouted Guy.</p>

<p>Meriel nodded.</p>

<p>"Bring her up into the wind the moment I tell you,"
he said. He cast loose the painter of the dingey towing
aft, and stood with it in his hand, watching patiently.
The dark object reappeared not a dozen yards away.
He had already kicked off his boots. He dropped the
painter.</p>

<p>"Now," he shouted to Meriel, and took a header
straight into the tossing water.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>Guy had not trusted to Meriel in vain. When he rose to the surface
and shook the water out of his eyes he saw that the yacht was lying-to
not half a cable's length away. He had barely time to appreciate the
fact when the object he had dived for floated towards him. He caught
a glimpse of a despairing face, and the next moment he had grasped
Flurscheim by the collar and was striking out strongly in the direction
of the dingey, drifting, like themselves, with the tide, only a few
yards away. Flurscheim had struggled when Guy had first gripped him,
but his struggles had soon ceased. Guy got him to the side of the
boat, but could not hoist him aboard. He threw one arm over the stern
and hung on, supporting Flurscheim with the other hand. He had not to
wait very long. The accident had been observed from the deck of the
connoisseur's yacht, and two of her crew, tumbling hastily into their
own dingey, came swiftly to the rescue. Flurscheim was hauled aboard;
Guy followed, and as he bent over the Jew his eyes opened, and a glance
of recognition came into them.</p>

<p>"Not much the worse for your ducking, eh, Mr. Flurscheim?"
asked Guy.</p>

<p>The connoisseur struggled into a sitting position. He
held out his hand mutely. Guy took it for a moment in
his, then turned to the men who had come to their assistance.</p>

<p>He pointed to the drifting dingey. "If you'll get hold of that,
I'll pull myself aboard," he said quietly. "Mr. Flurscheim will be
all right." He was obeyed, and a minute later he stepped aboard the
<i>Witch</i>, and, once more taking the tiller, brought her up to the
wind and steered for home.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>Meriel said nothingâ€”what could she say? To her Guy's action was
heroic. His coolness, the absolute confidence with which he had set
about the work of rescue, the ease with which he had performed the
task he had set himself, revealed qualities which filled her with
admiration. Yet the man who possessed these qualities was a thief. No,
there was nothing she could say.</p>

<p>The <i>Witch</i> flew homewards, and the Hall came into
view.</p>

<p>"Will you take the tiller again, Miss Challys?" he
asked, as the boat neared the buoy.</p>

<p>She took it from him mechanically. He went forward,
hauled in the foresail, and, as the boat came about,
dropped the peak. The <i>Witch</i> drove leisurely on to her
moorings, and in a couple of minutes she was fast.
There was no time to waste. Meriel hastened to his
assistance. She worked side by side in stowing away the
canvas. The storm held off, though the clouds had
nearly covered the sky by the time everything had been
made snug aboard.</p>

<p>"Come," said Guy, as he drew the dingey alongside.
Meriel stepped into the boat, and a dozen strokes took
them to the bank.</p>

<p>"We shall just manage to get home before the storm
breaks," he continued, as he handed her ashore, and,
following, made the painter fast to the guide rope.</p>

<p>He was right in his estimate, though they had to hasten their
footsteps to gain shelter, for almost as soon as they had reached the
top of the wall the lightning blazed out, and the thunder crashed
at the same moment. Meriel had been on the verge of hysteria. The
atmospheric tumult had come at a time when her nerves were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
shattered; she wanted to shriek, but her muscles seemed to fail her.</p>

<p>"A near thing," said Guy. The equability of his voice gave Meriel
renewed confidence. She looked up at his face and wondered that it was
flushed with delight. She stumbled, Guy's hand steadied her. He caught
her up in his arms, and carried her onwards. She felt a delicious sense
of safety, and immediately the thought followedâ€”he is a thief. They
came to the lawn gate, and he set her on her feet.</p>

<p>She forgot the storm. She laid her hand on his arm.
"Tell me it is untrue," she cried.</p>

<p>He took both her hands in his. "I love you, Meriel," he said simply.
"I wish I could say, 'Yes, it is untrue,' but I cannot." He took her
arm, and hurried her across the lawn until they stood beneath the
porch. There, with one piteous glance, she left him without another
word.</p>

<p>His eyes followed her along the passage, then he turned and went out
into the storm. He was the only living thing abroad, and he rejoiced
in the solitude. He had no fear of the revolting elements. Their mood
suited his. He would have welcomed the flash which should scar his
body, even as the lightning of his emotions had seared his soul. He
had told himself that his story would kill the love that he had seen
springing up in Meriel's heart, but all the while he had hoped that
it would survive the stroke he would deal at the root. How much he
had hoped, he had not realised until he saw the anguish on her face,
until he saw that she had shrunk from him. He could have borne anger,
taunts even, but silenceâ€”the silence of contempt, for so he translated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
Meriel's attitudeâ€”that filled him with bitterness. There was no hope
for him. He was overwhelmed with youth's Byronic despair. Heedless of
his path, he went onward. The thunder crashed, later the rain fell, but
he pressed onwards blindly.</p>

<p>The awakening came when the storm, passing away,
gave place to a golden sunset. Guy found himself far
away from sight of human habitation, with the sea on
one hand and on the other the saltings stretching away
to the horizon. The passing of the storm brought no
renewal of hope to him. He was wearied mentally and
physically. He knew the direction in which Whitsea lay,
and he turned his face towards it.</p>

<p>It was dark by the time he arrived at the Hall, and he heard the
dinner gong as he entered the door. He did not obey his first impulse
to shirk facing the inmates of the house. He threw off his rain-sodden
clothes, and put on conventional dinner attire so swiftly that he was
ready before the second gong sounded.</p>

<p>"Meriel will not be down," said Mrs. Marven, as he
entered the drawing-room. "The storm has given her
a headache. I am so sorry, as it is your last evening."</p>

<p>Guy could only murmur something unintelligible while he told himself
bitterly that the girl would not even look upon him.

<small>EXPECTATION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Lynton Hora felt more uneasiness than he would have
acknowledged at Guy's failure to communicate with him.
Nor did the daily reports with which Cornelius Jessel
supplied him do anything to allay his disquietude. These
would have furnished entertainment for the Commandatore
had they related to anybody but Guy. Indeed, the
shadow-man's matter-of-fact chronicle of the day-by-day
doings of a young man in love would have been food for
mirth to the mildest cynic.</p>

<p>"Took G.'s shaving water at seven. Dâ€”â€”d me because he scraped
himself shaving. Said I hadn't stropped the razors properly. As soon
as he was up he went into the garden and helped Miss Challys syringe
the rose trees. They went into breakfast together. After breakfast he
sent me down to the village to see if some music he had ordered for
Miss Challys had arrived. When I got back, found he had gone out in the
boat with Miss Challys for a sail. Did not come back until dinner-time.
Saw them come home. They had been alone together all day. Heard the
Captain say to Mrs. M., 'We shall not have to wait very long now for an
announcement.' She answered, 'They hardly seem to remember that there's
anybody else in the world....'"</p>

<p>But Lynton Hora was not amused by the report as he
would have been had Guy taken him into his confidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
respecting what was obviously an affair of the heart.
He knew Guy well enough to be aware that he was
always in deadly earnest in any pursuit in which he was
engaged, and he dreaded the influence which a pure,
straightforward woman might have upon him. If Meriel
Challys had been the sort of woman who amused herself
by luring a man on to a declaration, he would have
been delighted at Guy's infatuation, the lesson would
have been good for him. But he could not lull his forebodings
by any such narcotic.</p>

<p>He saw Guy drifting away from him, throwing overboard the whole
cargo of criminal philosophy which had been so carefully provided for
him, at the bidding of a mere girl. He had no fear for himself. Guy
might recant the faith in which he had been brought up, but Lynton Hora
did not for a moment imagine that the recantation would be accompanied
by any treachery towards himself. Loyalty was a distinguishing feature
of Guy's nature. He would never reveal anything which would injure the
man whom he looked upon as father. The Commandatore felt perfectly safe
on that point, so long as Guy should not learn, nor even suspect, that
he, Lynton Hora, was not his fatherâ€”the Commandatore did not pursue
the thought, though he foresaw the possibility and had provided what
he thought would be a complete defence against any trouble to himself
through the awakening of such a suspicion. Lynton Hora left as little
as possible to chance, and ordinary caution had led him to anticipate
the possibility of the discovery of Guy's real parentage, even though
the possibility was of the remotest.</p>

<p>But it was not only the question of danger to himself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
which troubled him. It was the thought that Guy would
no longer be his son. All those years he had spent in
moulding the boy's mind had not been without effect on
Lynton Hora. Unknowingly he had given away what
he did not know that he possessed. It was in reality a
real human affection for his foster child which made him
so perturbed. Cold as he had always been in his outward
demeanour, he had learned, when Guy had departed
to chambers of his own, that without him life had
somehow suddenly ceased to interest him. The fanatical
priest rearing the victim for sacrifice upon the altar of an
unappeasable deity suddenly realised that he had learned
to love the proposed victim. Yet, rather than he should
fall under the influence of the man whom he looked upon
as his bitterest enemy, he would have sacrificed the victim
even if he should eternally regret the oblation.</p>

<p>He did not, it is true, anticipate such necessity. He allowed for
Guy's youth. Youth was ever impressionable and romantic, changing in
its fancy, and ever amenable to the mutable feminine. Once let him
be removed from the presence of Meriel Challys and Hora thought that
Guy might be weaned from his obvious infatuation. Indeed, there was a
probability that his romantic imaginings might be turned to account.
The young man, floundering out of his depths in the quicksands of
romantic imaginings, might be easily captured by the wiles of a really
clever woman.</p>

<p>Hora set himself earnestly to work to tutor Myra in the part he
destined her to play in the recalling of Guy. He did so entirely by
suggestion. He had taken her away from London, telling her that she
needed sea air to restore the roses of her complexion, if she wished to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
be beautiful in Guy's eyes when she returned to town. Then, when away,
he continued, day by day, hour by hour almost, to sting her emotions.
His sneers were all directed at the virtuous woman; never had Myra
found him so entertaining. He excited her imagination by the books he
brought her to read, tales of passionate surrender, memoirs of the
courts of bygone centuries, when love and lechery were synonymous
terms. He talked to her much of Guy, dwelling on his physical
attributes, declaring that he was as other men. If Myra realised any
intention in his words, she gave no sign of doing so. Then one day,
soon after leaving town, Hora gave a hint that perhaps already some
rival was claiming Guy's kisses. At that suggestion Myra's eyes flashed
dangerously. Hora noted the glance.</p>

<div class="figcenter width400">
<img src="images/facing226.jpg" width="400" alt="facing226">
<div class="caption">
<p>"You will take me home again."</p>
</div></div>

<p>"There's only one perfect revenge upon a rival," Hora
remarked, "and that is to steal away the rival's lover."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to tell me that Guyâ€”â€”" said Myra, heedless of the
suggestion. She could not utter the words which would have voiced her
fear that Guy had already given his love to another.</p>

<p>"I tell you that there is a chit of a girl in the country who, if
she knew as much as you do, would have taken Guy from us long ago.
Fortunately she is a fool, or Guy would be lost; as it is, Myra, your
chance has not yet passed."</p>

<p>She hoped not, and though she doubted, Hora's confidence
reassured her.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, as they passed a stationer's shop,
with a window full of photographs of actresses, Hora
paused and directed her attention to the portrait of a
flagrantly dÃ©colletÃ© woman.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span></p>

<p>"You have a finer figure than that woman," he remarked.</p>

<p>Myra blushed, and they passed on without another
word. Later on Myra returned to the shop alone and
obtained the photograph.</p>

<p>After dinner she let fall an observation that her wardrobe needed
replenishing. Hora grumbled, but she teased him into giving her a
cheque. His face was perfectly grave. Next day she sent the photograph
and the cheque, accompanied by a long letter of instructions, to Madame
Gabrielle, her London dressmaker. Three days later Madame Gabrielle
arrived in Scarborough and Myra gave the whole morning to the tedious
business of fitting. Hora asked no questions.</p>

<p>The day came for their return to town. Myra was feverishly anxious
to be off, fearful lest Guy should be back before them, fearful lest he
should not come back at all. He had not written once, either to her or
to Hora during the whole fortnight. Hora did his best to mitigate her
obvious anxiety.</p>

<p>"No doubt we shall find a letter waiting for us on our
return," he said.</p>

<p>His surmise proved correct. The letter which Jessel
had posted for Guy that same morning at Whitsea was
lying on the table in the entrance hall. Myra seized it
eagerly. Her colour came and went as Hora opened it
deliberately.</p>

<p>"What does he say? When is he coming?" she cried.</p>

<p>For answer Hora read the letter aloud.</p>

<p>"I am returning to town to-morrow, after spending
a fortnight with Captain Marven, and I have something
important to tell you. I am afraid you won't like what
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
I have to say, but I cannot help myself, even if it should
lead to a parting of our ways. Yes, I fear it has come to
that. I will come in to-morrow after dinner, if you will
be at home."</p>

<p>That was all. Hora's voice became harsh as he read,
and as he finished he crumbled the letter in his hand,
and threw it aside.</p>

<p>"A parting of the ways. It has come to that, has
it?" he muttered. His face grew dark and his eyes
flashed dangerously. "A parting of the ways, and all
for the sake of a milk-and-water country girl. What do
you say to that, Myra?"</p>

<p>He turned suddenly upon his companion. He was almost alarmed at what
he saw. Her face was deathlike in its pallor, and in her pale face her
dark eyes flashed with unnatural brightness. She reeled slightly and
grasped with both hands at a table to steady herself. He did not press
the question. He led her to a chair, turned swiftly to a tantalus, and,
pouring brandy into a glass, held it to her lips.</p>

<p>"You fool," he said, and his tone was kindly, though
his words were rough. "You fool, to set such store
by any piece of mere frail humanity. Drink this."</p>

<p>Myra obeyed the command. Gradually the colour
came back to her cheeks. She sat up, but her mouth
drooped at the corners, there was despair in her eyes.</p>

<p>"I could not help but give him my love," she said
protestingly, "and he will have none of it."</p>

<p>Hora turned aside, and paced the room irresolutely.
He seated himself at a writing-table, scribbled rapidly,
and, when he had finished, brought the note over to
Myra. She read it listlessly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>"Dear Guy," Hora had written, "you are a most amazing person, and
I haven't the slightest idea as to the meaning of your melodramatic
phrases. You know you may always please yourself as to anything you
choose to do. If you do not like your profession, by all means change
it for any of the legalised forms of plunder, but, even if this is in
your thoughts, you need not worry over it. A man has an inalienable
right to please himself, and I shall not think less of you for making
your own decision, even if that decision is one which destroys all my
hopes of a successor. You will find I can discuss the matter quite
philosophically, but come before dinner to-morrow night, and we will
have a quiet chat over a cigar afterwards. If our ways are to lie
apart, you need not quite desert us. Perhaps you might even convince
me, not, perhaps, that my calling is not as honourable as any other
parasitic method of living, but that I might do well at my age to
retire from the active practice of my profession. Dinner at 8.30.
Yours, Lynton Hora."</p>

<p>Myra read the letter, but the perusual brought no hope to her.
Hora folded it, placed it in an envelope, sealed and stamped it
deliberately. He rang the bell and ordered the letter to be posted.
Myra still sat silent. Then Hora said to her quietly:</p>

<p>"You will have to entertain Guy alone to-morrow,
Myra. I shall be called away on important business."</p>

<p>"I cannot, indeed I cannot," she cried.</p>

<p>He continued deaf to her protest. "It is your only chance, Myra.
To-morrow night you must win him or lose him forever. You must not
failâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>He turned and left the room, leaving the threat unspoken.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>She sat there long after he departed.</p>

<p>Her only chance! In one or two brief hours she must bind Guy to
her indissolubly. Hora had taught her, without ever once uttering a
word which might offend, how she could win him if she so chose. He had
insisted upon Guy's chivalrous nature. He had insisted, too, that the
most Puritanical of men could be fascinated by an appeal to the senses.
Thoughts came to her which set her cheeks burning. But she could not
banish those thoughts. She remained motionless until a maid appeared to
ask if she could see Madame Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Yes, at once," she answered. "Bring her to my
room."</p>

<p>Her listlessness had entirely departed as she rose and hurried after
the maid. A minute later the dressmaker was ushered into her presence.
The woman was a voluble specimen of her type, and as she unpacked the
box she descanted freely on the beauties of the "creation" she had
brought with her. She became more voluble than ever when Myra was robed
in the new frock.</p>

<p>"Ah, but it is ravishing; mademoiselle's figure is magnificent, and
the tint suits mademoiselle's complexion and colouring to perfection.
Oh, but it is a pity mademoiselle is in London. Only in Paris could
such a work of art be appreciated. Ah, mademoiselle has the right idea
of dress. It is a pleasure to make for her."</p>

<p>With deft fingers she fluttered round, settling a tuck
here, smoothing a fold there. "Let mademoiselle observe
for herself," said the woman.</p>

<p>Myra surveyed herself in the full-length mirror. Madame Gabrielle
was right. Her skin was dazzlingly fair against the dull rose tint of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
the fabric. Cleverly, too, had the modiste followed the lines of her
customer's figure. Not a single graceful curve had been hidden. Yet
Myra felt no sense of nudity. All outlines were softened by careful
arrangement of chiffon.</p>

<p>Myra turned to the woman. "You have carried out
my idea exactly. I am very pleased," she said.</p>

<p>Madame Gabrielle beamed with gratification. She began again to
express her pleasure in gowning such a perfect figure. Myra cut her
short. She wanted to be alone. When the woman had departed, she
approached the mirror again and looked steadily at the reflection.
Taking up a hand glass, she moved backwards and forwards, up and down,
posturing in a score of different ways. Then suddenly she flung herself
down upon her knees by the side of a chair and threw her arms in the
air with a cry of despair. Something gave way in the new frock, but she
paid no heed.</p>

<p>"Oh, Guy, Guy!" she wailed. But the cry was hardly
uttered before it was checked. She bit her lip, and looked
again at the mirror to gather courage.</p>

<p>She blushed. A string had broken, and the bodice had
slipped. Suppose that Guy had answered her call. Her
heart beat almost as tumultuously as if he had been present.
She made a pin do service for the broken string,
and, smiling again, went in search of Hora.</p>

<p>She found him in his study with a volume of the
"Arabian Nights" open before him, but with his eyes
gazing into vacancy. He did not glance at her as she
entered. She moved gracefully across the room until
she stood before him, then she asked simply:</p>

<p>"Shall I do, Commandatore?"</p>

<p>Her voice was low, alluring, with a spice of mockery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
in it. Hora looked up impatiently, and he caught his
breath. His impatience vanished. A smile passed over
his face. Then he looked critically at his <i>vis-Ã -vis</i>, so
critically that Myra flushed rosily and half turned away.</p>

<p>"Do?" said Hora. "If I had lived in the fifteenth
century, I should have declared that you had been taking
counsel with the devil."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I have," she replied, but the mockery was
still in her voice.</p>

<p>"I believe you could bewitch even me, if you chose,"
he said as he looked again. "You would serve for a
picture of temptation incarnate."</p>

<p>She laughed happily, and her eyes shone softly.</p>

<p>"It is for Guy," she answered, "all for Guy."</p>

<p>Lynton Hora recovered his wonted mood.</p>

<p>"Lucky young devil," he remarked cynically. His
mood changed again. "Look here, Myra," he cried.
"You and Guy must be married as soon as it can be
managed. No, you need not interrupt me. You can
keep him here until I return, and a special license can be
obtained. When he leaves this flat it must be only with
his bride. I will make all arrangements, and"â€”he
paused before continuing,â€”"afterwards, you shall have
your wish. Guy shall engage in no more dangerous enterprises.
We will sign an armistice with the world."</p>

<p>Myra gave a cry of delight. She seized Hora's hand, pressing it
between her own two palms. "You are too good to me, Commandatore," she
said earnestly. "So good to me, and yet I fear. Iâ€”I don't want the
license. I only want Guy to love me; ifâ€”if he doesn'tâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Tears stood in her eyes, and a sob choked her utterance.</p>

<p>"Guy cannot but love you," answered Hora, and he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
truly believed what he said. "No man in his senses
could reject such devotion as yours, when once he is
aware of its depths."</p>

<p>"Butâ€”Iâ€”I cannot tell him," she said helplessly, dropping
her hand.</p>

<p>Hora looked at her curiously.</p>

<p>"No?" he said. "There will be plenty of time for
that afterwards. First you have to win him." He
caught one of her hands in his own, and something of
his own virile power seemed to be transmitted to her.
"You are irresistible in some moods, Myra, and, if I
were forty years younger and could be foolish again, I
would take care that Guy never came near you. If you
wish, you may be as certain of winning him as that to-morrow
will dawn." His tone denoted absolute conviction.</p>

<p>Myra drew away her hand.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Commandatore," she said. She gave
him her cheek, and he brushed it lightly with his lips before
she turned away and left him without another word.</p>

<p>"Good heavens!" he muttered to himself, when the
door closed behind her. "If I were forty years
youngerâ€”â€”" He smiled cynically, and added:</p>

<p>"I don't think we have come to the parting of the
ways just yet, Guy."

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII<br>
<small>TEMPTATION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>The last evening Guy had spent at Whitsea had seemed interminable.
Both his host and hostess had observed his depression, but tactfully
took no notice. Then when Guy was alone with Captain Marven he had
braced himself to give what explanation he could. He spoke of his
love for Merielâ€”Captain Marven was sympathetic. He spoke of its
hopelessnessâ€”Captain Marven wondered. Haltingly he revealed that he had
considered it his duty to disclose facts concerning himself which had
placed an insuperable barrier between them. The initial embarrassment
in finding speech once surmounted, he had no difficulty in making clear
to his host that it would be best that he should depart by the earliest
possible train. Captain Marven was greatly disturbed. Guy's veiled
allusions were without meaning to him. He even feared that the young
man's brain was disordered, though his demeanour was calm enough to
reassure him. He begged Guy to confide in him fully. Guy longed to do
so, but refrained. The thought of his father restrained him. Marven was
compelled to agree that it was best for him to depart without further
speech with Meriel.</p>

<p>So Guy left Whitsea without even seeing Meriel again. He had
hungered for another glance from her eyes, another touch of her
fingers, but neither had been vouchsafed to him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span></p>

<p>He left early in the morning, and only Captain Marven
bade him adieu. The Captain's hearty handshake was
comforting, even though Guy felt, as the warm grasp
closed on his, that it was given under false pretences.
He loathed himself more than ever at that moment, and
there crept into his mind the determination to make
amends.</p>

<p>But how? Guy could think of no way, for there was
his father to be considered. He would have liked to say
to Captain Marven: "You must not take my hand. I
have obtained your friendship under false pretences.
I have robbed you of your trust. Now I ask you to
name the punishment." That would be manly, but it
would be treachery to Hora.</p>

<p>Guy groaned in his spirit. One thing he was determined upon. In the
future the son should not tread in the steps of his father. Hora's
arguments might convince his understanding, but they would not bear
the test of practical application. The world was not the agglomeration
of warring atoms he had been taught to believe. Honesty was not a
pious hypocrisy with which men deluded themselves. A courage for the
forbidden was not the greatest of all virtues. Meriel had shattered all
these old beliefs. He knew that they were gone forever, that in the
future Lynton Hora's predatory philosophy would cease to appeal to him.
But he had nothing to take the place of these shattered principles.
Nothing but the memory of a girl who, loving him, thrust him away in
horror that he should be a thief. He loathed himself because he should
be an object of loathing to her. He could not bear the idea that his
needs should be supplied by means which awakened her to such disgust.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
At least it was within his power to alter that. He could go out into
the world and make his own way honestly. If he could not win Meriel, at
least he could prove himself worthy of her. But that would necessitate
his cutting himself adrift from Hora entirely. Well, he would pay
that price gladly. He would waste no time before doing so. Yet,
though he arrived early in town, he did not go at once to Westminster
Mansions.</p>

<p>He found Hora's letter awaiting him at his own abode, and was
surprised, even touched, by its contents. Hora seemed to have guessed
at the upheaval his opinions had undergone, and to be prepared to
meet him halfway. Guy was relieved at the thought. He had dreaded
his father's gibes more than aught else, and he wondered what should
have happened to have so suddenly made the Commandatore malleable to
a mere suggestionâ€”he who had always been so fiercely insistent upon
his right to dominate the lives of his children. Guy puzzled for hours
for an answer. He did not distrust Hora. The Commandatore had not been
accustomed to deceive him.</p>

<p>Thus preyed upon by a whole host of conflicting thoughts, Guy passed
the day, and at last the hour arrived when he was due at Westminster
Mansions. He was averse to accepting Hora's hospitality, to sit at
the table supplied by means he had learnt to detest. In a few hours
his thoughts had travelled a tremendous distance. He was not of the
type which palters with convictions. Just as whole-heartedly as he
had adopted Hora's teachings, he was prepared to tread the path of
rectitude. But he felt that he would not be at peace with himself until
he had divested himself of every vestige of the products of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
his evil deeds. Yet, though the acceptance of Hora's invitation
savoured of compromise, he realised that it would be ungracious to
refuse. Hora had been good to him, even if misguided. There was no need
that they should part in anger.</p>

<p>It was with the sense of a prisoner under sentence of
death that he dressed. Cornelius might have been a
warder assisting him on the execution morn. It was for
the last time. To-morrow he would be quite alone. He
set his teeth grimly and fought against the feeling of depression
as he drove to Westminster Mansions. His mind
was abnormally active. He observed details that would
have escaped his attention under ordinary circumstances.
He saw that the hall porter looked at him curiously, and
wondered why. The deferential welcome of the lift man
irritated him.</p>

<p>Arrived at the flat he felt in his pocket for the key of
the outer door which Lynton Hora had insisted upon his
retaining, and he was annoyed to find that he had left it
at his chambers. He had intended to leave it behind him.
He rang, and the man who opened the door seemed surprised.</p>

<p>"Is my father in?" he asked, as he handed the man
his hat.</p>

<p>"No, sir," the man answered.</p>

<p>Guy paused irresolutely. He himself was late. "Won't
he be back for dinner?" he asked. Before he could
reply the door of the drawing-room opened.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Guy? How is it that you troubled to
ring? Have you lost your key?"</p>

<p>Myra came, with outstretched hands, to greet him.
"Welch, take Mr. Guy's coat, and we will have dinner
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
served at once," she said to the man, and, turning to Guy,
she continued rapidly:</p>

<p>"The Commandatore was called away on business, and
he told me not to wait dinner. He expects to be back
during the evening." Guy submitted, and followed her
into the drawing-room.</p>

<p>"You are a stranger, Guy," she said. "I think it is
downright mean of you to desert us."</p>

<p>Guy, meeting her glance, told himself that he had been
egregiously mistaken in thinking that Myra had ever
thought of him save as a brother.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to have suffered from my absence,"
he said lightly.</p>

<p>"Don't you think I have grown thin?" she answered.
There was mockery in her tone.</p>

<p>Guy was glad to find her in so cheerful a mood. He
smiled back at her, and for the first time looked at her
with seeing eyes. She stood before him in the perfection
of her young womanhood, glowing with health and
youth and beauty. Truly she was beautiful. He wondered
that he not realised how beautiful before. He
did not know how carefully she had studied the part she
intended to play. He had no idea that the gown, which
adorned and but half concealed the contours of her figure,
had been expressly designed for his allurement.</p>

<p>"I have never seen you looking so well," he answered.</p>

<p>She saw the admiration in his glance, but gave no sign
of doing so, though her heart began to throb with hope.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't return the compliment," she answered.
"You look as if you hadn't been to bed for a
week. Now come along in to dinner and tell me what
you have been doing with yourself."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>She took his arm, and they entered the dining-room together.
"For the last time, perhaps," he murmured to
himself regretfully. Myra was a good sort, he mused.
Despite her waves of anger she had always been thoughtful
of his welfare. Yet she was part of Hora's life. He
forgot her momentarily in his surroundings. Everything
was so homelike. Meriel Challys was an occupant of
dreamland, surely, and he had never really experienced
all the mental disturbances which had troubled him. He
awoke to reality with the popping of a cork.</p>

<p>"No wine," he said.</p>

<p>Myra pouted rosy lips at him. "I insist," she replied
imperiously. "In default of a fatted calf, which one cannot
possibly get served in a flat, I insist upon champagne."</p>

<p>She lifted her glass to her lips. "May all our hopes
come true!" she said, and drank.</p>

<p>There was something infectious in her gaiety. Guy
raised his glass in response. "Amen!" he said fervently.
The wine brought colour to his cheeks and
brightness to his eyes. He suddenly remembered that he
was hungry, and that he had eaten nothing since breakfast,
and that then a bare morsel of toast had been almost
more than he could swallow. Myra watched him with a
smile ever on her lips, and chattered vivaciously of Scarborough.
She did not ask him concerning his doings.
She desired to lull his memories to rest, and Guy was
willing to let them slumber. He did not perceive that
danger threatened his new-made resolutions.</p>

<p>Under the spell of Myra's vivacity he became his
natural self. He was even surprised when he found
himself laughing naturally. The dinner was not too long,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and every dish, Guy noted, was one for which at one time
or another he had expressed a preference. He was
thirsty, and his glass was always full.</p>

<p>The dinner came to an end.</p>

<p>"We will have coffee in the drawing-room," she said.
"Then I can smoke, too."</p>

<p>He rose and accompanied her. Her hope was growing
strong now. She was satisfied with her work so far.
She had never before held Guy's interest for so long a
time.</p>

<p>"Your old chair," she said to him, as they entered together.</p>

<p>A fire was blazing merrily on the hearth, for the heat
wave which had swept the city had been driven away by
the storm, and the night was cold.</p>

<p>"Fires in August," he said, as he entered.</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely.</p>

<p>"There's something comforting to me in the fire," she
answered. "Especially now I'm so much alone. I often
have one lighted whatever the thermometer says, and
sit for hours looking into it."</p>

<p>She knelt down on the snowy fur of the rug, and
stretched her arms to the blaze.</p>

<p>Guy was stricken again with a sense of her beauty.
Her eyes were half closed. She might have been a
priestess offering an oblation to the spurting flames
which threw rosy shadows on her face and arms and
shoulders.</p>

<p>"I love the fire," she said dreamily. "I think I am
almost a fire-worshipper. When the flames spring up,
my heart rejoices so that I can sing aloud, and when they
die down into a dull red glow, I can dream and dream.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
But when the fire is outâ€”Guy! Don't you just hate
ashesâ€”cold ashes?"</p>

<p>She turned on him suddenly.</p>

<p>He did not know what to reply. He did not know
Myra in this mood.</p>

<p>She looked again into the fire.</p>

<p>"The end of everything is ashes, and so I would wish the fire never
to go out. Some day our fires will be out, and we shall be ashes, too.
Do you ever think of that, Guy?"</p>

<p>He thought bitterly that his hopes were ashes already,
but he strove to infuse cheerfulness into his reply.</p>

<p>"Isn't that rather morbid, Myra?" he said.</p>

<p>She turned towards him again, and laid her hand on
the arm of his chair. "No," she answered. "I say
to myself, make the most of the fire while it is there, for
to ashes it must come at last. That's no morbid doctrine."
She laughed joyously, and shot a glance at him
beneath her eyelids. "The fire is alight in us both,
Guy. The fire of youth and health and strength. Ought
we not to make the most of the fire before it burns itself
out?"</p>

<p>For half a moment Guy was startled. The glance, the
words, the covert invitation of the outstretched arms
dazed him. Almost he believed that the invitation was
to him. But the thought passed. Myra was laughing
again. "You see, I am growing up, Guy," she remarked.</p>

<p>A man brought in coffee and liquors. Myra waited
on Guy, bringing him a cigarette and lighting it for him,
as he sat in his chair. Then she perched herself on the
arm to light her own cigarette from his. As she bent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
over him a sudden mad impulse to clasp her in his arms
seized him. A memoryâ€”the memory of Merielâ€”came
before him and the impulse passed, but it left him
strangely agitated.</p>

<p>Myra seemed to observe nothing of this emotion. She threw herself
at length upon the rug, resting her head on her hand, gazing into the
fire. The sinuous lines of her figure were outlined clearly against the
whiteness of the rug. She rose suddenly, and without a word snapped off
the electric lights and, returning, threw herself down again in the
same attitude. She seemed oblivious of his presence. The murmur of the
traffic entered through the open window, the firelight flickered. Guy
began to feel as if some unknown agency were at work to deprive him of
his senses. Myra's words dwelt in his mind. "The fire is alight in us
both, Guy. Ought we not to make the most of the fire before it burns
itself out?"</p>

<p>There was a murmur of voices in the hall. Guy listened.
Perhaps the Commandatore had returned. A
door closed sharply. There was no other sound. He
realised then that the servants had gone. He was alone
with Myra in the flat. It had happened hundreds of
times previously, but never had he realised it before.
Perhaps it was that the Myra with whom he had dined
was so entirely new to him, an utterly different Myra to
the sisterly being with whom he had quarrelled and
petted when they lived under the same roof. Supposing
Hora should not returnâ€”â€”</p>

<p>Myra was looking at him. She had turned where she
lay and resting on her elbows she was gazing up at him.
There was a challenge in her glance.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span></p>

<p>"Am I beautiful, Guy?" she asked.</p>

<p>His brain whirled. He fought against the web which
seemed to be enveloping him against his will. He did
not know that the languor which possessed him was
largely due to reaction after the mental and physical
strain he had so recently undergone. His voice was
husky as he evaded the question.</p>

<p>"What strange devil possesses you to-night, Myra?"</p>

<p>"I am beautiful, am I not?" she repeated.</p>

<p>She had drawn herself up to his knees, and knelt beside
his chair.</p>

<p>"You have never told me I am beautiful," she whispered
coaxingly. Her hair brushed his cheeks. Her lips
were very near his. Without his will, it seemed, his
hand fell upon her firm white arm, and he thrilled at the
touch.</p>

<p>"Myra, Myra, you will steal away my soul."</p>

<p>The cry was wrung from him.</p>

<p>Her eyes flashed. It was as if the fire she had spoken
of had burst into a blaze.</p>

<p>"I have given you mine long ago," she answered. Her arms were thrown
about him. "Guy, don't you know, haven't you seen how I love you?" She
whispered the words tremulously while her drooping lids half veiled the
passion glowing in her eyes, and her bosom rose and fell stormily. "No
one can ever love you as I love you, Guy."</p>

<p>She thought she was secure of victory. Her lips half parted for the
expected kiss. Guy had risen, holding her tightly to him. She drooped
in his arms. Almost he was won. "You have stolen my love," she murmured.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>What strange fate brought those particular words to her lips? Guy,
thrilling in response to the passion which throbbed in her veins, his
senses enthralled by the diablerie of her beauty, remembered that
Meriel had used the very same words. He forgot where he was. Once again
he was on the deck of the yacht, becalmed, and hope had passed him by
with a flowing sail. Had hope come again? Myra loved him. And he had
not stolen her love. His conscience was clear there. Yet she loved
him, and he was hungry for love. Could he give her love in return? He
knew that he could not. Passion he could give, a short-lived fire. No,
no, no! A thousand times no. It would be desecration of the memory he
cherished. The conflict was brief.</p>

<p>He gently loosened the entwining arms which held
him. He could not trust himself to speak. He placed
the girl gently in the chair and turned away. She sprang
after him, realising his intention.</p>

<p>"Guy," she cried, "you cannot be so cruel."</p>

<p>There was agony in her voice, and despair in her gesture.
She was carried away by the violence of her emotion.</p>

<p>"I only ask you to love me a little." Her words were those of a
child pleading. "I will be so good, so good. I only want to be near
you, Guy. I won't ask you to be all mine, only that sometimes you
will be kind and remember me." Her mood changed. She threw herself to
her knees. "I am beautiful, Guy, I know I am beautiful. There are not
many women so beautiful as I am, Guy, andâ€”â€”" She held up her hands
pleadingly. "You won't leave me all aloneâ€”stop just this once, Guy."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span></p>

<p>He held her hands tightly, and as she looked into his
eyes she knew that her hope was vain. Her mouth
drooped at the corners. She freed her hands and
dropped, a pathetic figure of despair, on to the rug.</p>

<p>Guy walked to the door. But he could not leave her
so. He came back and knelt beside her.</p>

<p>"If I believed in God, I would say, 'God help both
of us, Myra.'" There was a quiver of pain in his voice.
"I, too, love, and my love is hopeless. I did not know,
Myra."</p>

<p>She was listening, and now she raised herself. The
passion had gone out of her face. Her eyes were dull.</p>

<p>"It does not matter," she said. "I have been a fool."</p>

<p>He paid no heed to her words, but went on steadily.</p>

<p>"My love is hopeless," he said. "I do not think I can ever love
again, but here am I, and if you think"â€”he hesitated a momentâ€”"if you
think I can make you happy in any wayâ€”Myra, will you marry me? You
shall have no cause to complain."</p>

<p>A sob shook her frame. "No," she said, "I have
been a fool. It is your love I want, and now I know it
cannot be mine, I want to be alone." She pointed to the
fire. "The flames have died away. Soon there will
only be dead ashes. Help me up, Guy." He assisted
her to rise. "I think I'll go to bed, Guy," she said.
"Good-night."</p>

<p>She held out one hand. He took both, and, drawing
her to him, kissed her. She responded with a kiss innocent
as a child's.</p>

<p>When she passed out he left the door ajar. Later on he went to the
door of her room and listened. He could hear her regular breathing and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
judged she slept. Yet he kept vigil until the dawn broke. Then he
ventured to peep into her room. Yes, she slept with tears glistening on
her eyelashes. The fear which had beset him, lest she should have been
tempted to end her life, was relieved. He put on his coat and hat, and
let himself out.</p>

<p>"Poor Myra!" he thought pityingly. He was developing
rapidly. The previous morning he had been pitying
himself.

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII<br>
<small>A FRIEND IN ADVERSITY</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Blue skies and sunshine and a rippling silver sea, all
nature jocund and gay, and for the first time in her
young life Meriel was unresponsive to the appeal. The
romance had gone out of life. The man she had learned
to love was a thiefâ€”a thief. She told herself fiercely
that she no longer loved him, that she had never loved
him, but the ache at her heart gave the lie to the declaration.</p>

<p>The perpetual ache at her heart! If she could only have shared the
burden with Mrs. Marven, taken advantage of her Aunt's sympathetic
counsel, sobbed out her trouble and her despair on that motherly
breast, the pain would have been easier to bear. But she could not do
that. Thief though he was, Meriel could not betray Guy's confidence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marven wondered at the girl's reticence. Yet she waited in
patience for the confidence which was not yet given. Sooner or later
she felt it would be given to her. Her husband had told her of Guy's
conversation with him. She gathered that no ordinary blow had shattered
her darling's romance, and, though she longed to counsel and to
comfort, to mingle her tears with Meriel's, yet she did not press her
for the confidence which was withheld.</p>

<p>Yet, though the girl suffered, she strove to put her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
misery from her, to busy herself with trivial duties. She went to
the garden, but she could not remain amongst the flowers. Her glance
fell on a rose Guy had tied. Now it was battered by the storm, and
shapelessâ€”like her romance. She passed through the garden, across the
meadow, and on to the sea-wall. She desired to be alone, that was all.
She strolled idly along, unseeing anything but the tide slowly rising
over the mud, quite unconscious of the approach of an acquaintance.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim had recognised Meriel while yet some
distance away, and had hastened his footsteps. He had wondered that she
was alone, but congratulated himself on the fact, for then Guy would
probably be alone, too. He wanted a private conference with Guy. He,
too, had been troubled greatly in his thoughts during the previous day
and night. Ever since Cornelius Jessel had revealed to him the fact
that one item of his missing property was in Guy's possession, he had
been rejoicing in the thought that vengeance on his spoliators was soon
to be within his reach. Not that he wholly trusted the valet's word.
The shadow-man was not possessed of a confidence-inspiring personality,
but the man had not asked for any cash on account for the information
he had furnished. Flurscheim judged that the informer must have been
quite convinced as to the truth of his information, or he would not
have been so confiding. Flurscheim had arranged with him to secure the
miniature so that he might identify it. After that his course would be
simple. The police would do the rest. He blessed the lucky chance which
had brought him to recognise the strange likeness which existed between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
Meriel and the missing miniature. But for that curious coincidence he
might never have had the opportunity of getting on the track of his
missing treasures.</p>

<p>Meriel had been correct in her intuition when she
read another meaning in his warning to Guy to beware
of the approaching storm. He could not resist the jest.
But then the events which had immediately followed
played havoc with his plans and projects.</p>

<p>Guy had saved his life. Would the man who had robbed him have done
that? Hildebrand Flurscheim set great store by his life. When he felt
himself falling, when the water closed over his head, a great horror
possessed him. He struggled madly, blindly, against the fearful thing.
Then a strong hand had gripped him. He had still struggled until dimly
he had comprehended that a cool voice was commanding him to be still,
telling him that he was safe. The words repeated again and again had
impressed themselves upon his consciousness. He had ceased to struggle.
He had trusted entirely to the strong hand which supported him. Then,
he knew not how, other hands had lifted him up and taken him into a
boat. He had opened his eyes and seen Guy clamber up over the stern,
had heard him say, "Not much the matter, eh, Mr. Flurscheim?"</p>

<p>The experience seemed to have lasted hours. He said little, but he
had insisted, when Guy was put aboard the <i>Witch</i>, on shaking the
young man's hand. And when, afterwards, the horror of those moments
returned to him there was renewed in his mind the feeling of gratitude
to his preserver. He was glad that it was in his power to repay in some
measure the debt of gratitude he owed. Guy had given his life. Well, he
could give Guy liberty. Yet he was not altogether satisfied in his mind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
He had no reason for thinking that Guy had worked single-handed, and
he saw no reason why other parties should be participants in his
gratitude. Yet, rather than Guy should suffer, all the guilty parties
should escape. Certainly the experience of being at hand-grips with
death had wrought a wonderful change in Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim's
views, for it was with this determination in his mind that he left
his yacht, intending to call at the Hall and tell Guy of Jessel's
communication, and of his determination not to act upon the
information.</p>

<p>Not until he was a yard away and he spoke, did Meriel recognise the
connoisseur. A shadow of annoyance crossed her face. This man seemed
to her to be the cause, though a perfectly innocent cause, of Guy's
undoing. She bowed slightly, and would have passed by, but Flurscheim
stood in her path.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss Challys," he said, "can you tell me
where I can find Mr. Guy Hora? I have something of
importance to say to him."</p>

<p>There was a shade of agitation in his voice. Meriel
was startled. Again the thought came to her, "Did he
suspect Guy? Was that the explanation of the presence
of himself and his yacht at Whitsea?"</p>

<p>She strove to answer steadily.</p>

<p>"Mr. Hora left for London by the first train this
morning."</p>

<p>An exclamation of annoyance escaped Flurscheim. "It
is most important that I should see him at once. Most
important. Will you give me his address? I must send
him a wire immediately."</p>

<p>The colour left her face. She trembled. She was sure now that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
Flurscheim knew who had robbed him of his treasures, that his anxiety
was due to the fear lest the robber should escape him. How could she
warn Guy? How could she refuse to supply Flurscheim with the address
he asked? Even if she were to refuse, her aunt or uncle would give it.
They knew of no reason why it should be kept secret.</p>

<p>Flurscheim saw her hesitation, and a strange suspicion
germinated in his mind. "Surely she is not one of the
gang," he thought.</p>

<p>His intent gaze increased her discomposure. His suspicions
increased. He ventured a bold stroke.</p>

<p>"I wish to make some return for the service Mr. Hora has rendered
me," he said quietly. "Facts have come to my knowledge which go to show
that he is in considerable danger. If you do not trust me, will you
convey to him the warning?"</p>

<p>Again she looked at him doubtingly. "You would be
his friend?" she asked amazedly.</p>

<p>"If Mr. Hora will allow me," he answered, and seeing
that she still hesitated, he continued earnestly. "Will
you not believe me, Miss Challys, when I say that I would
do anything in my power to save Mr. Hora from a fate
which would mean absolute ruin to him. May I go so
far as to say that if you are in the slightest degree interested
in his welfare you will not waste any time in
communicating to him the message I will give you."</p>

<p>There was a deep feeling expressed more in his tone
than the words he used. Instinctively Meriel felt that he
was to be trusted.</p>

<p>"I will give you Guyâ€”Mr. Hora's address," she remarked.
"I cannot communicate with him myself."</p>

<p>"Whyâ€”I thoughtâ€”â€”" he remarked and paused.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>Meriel did not pretend to misunderstand the swiftly
checked exclamation. She shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"I am a very unhappy girl, Mr. Flurscheim," she said,
and despite her efforts tears mounted to her eyes.</p>

<p>"There! There! There! Say no more," interrupted
the connoisseur hastily. "Misunderstandings will occur
between young people."</p>

<p>Meriel again shook her head. "Yesterday Mr. Hora
told me something regarding himself which I could not
have suspected; part of what he told me concerned you,
Mr. Flurscheim, andâ€”so he has gone."</p>

<p>"Then the miniature did not come into his possession
by accident!" ejaculated Flurscheim. "And all the time
I was hoping that it had."</p>

<p>"No," said Meriel. "It was no accident." The words
slipped from her. Flurscheim realised that she knew all
about the robbery. He began to question her eagerly,
but she would answer him nothing. Already she had
been betrayed into a confidence which she regretted, and
when he realised her difficulty, he ceased to ask for details.</p>

<p>"It makes no difference in my intentions," he said.
"Whether Mr. Hora was himself the burglar who stole
my picture and the miniatures, or whether he was only
one of the parties who handled them afterwards, would
make no difference to my course of action. If he is
warned immediately there will be time for him to clear
out of the way. If notâ€”â€”" He shrugged his shoulders
expressively.</p>

<p>"But why?" asked Meriel.</p>

<p>Flurscheim repeated the story Jessel had told him.</p>

<p>"I can keep the man's mouth closed for a certain time," <span
class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span> he said, "but sooner or
later he will blab it out, and once the police get on the trackâ€”â€”"
Again he shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>Meriel was more than ever amazed at the Jew's attitude.
She let some of her surprise escape in speech.</p>

<p>"You, knowing where some of your valuables are, are willing
to forego all chance of their recovery, to let theâ€”the thiefâ€”go
unpunished? You who everybody says had determined to spend the whole of
the rest of your life on the recovery."</p>

<p>The Jew spread out the palms of his hands in a characteristically
racial gesture.</p>

<p>"The rest of my life," he said. "My life would have been ended
yesterday but for Mr. Guy Hora. Strange as it may seem, life is very
good in my eyes. I might never have known how good but for my accident.
It was slipping away and he gave it back to me. That was a debt which
I must repay. Miss Challys, never yet have I failed to meet every
obligation that I have incurred. Ask Christian or Jew who has ever had
dealings with me if Hildebrand Flurscheim has ever failed to take up
his bond when it became due."</p>

<p>She murmured something about the nobility of his attitude, but he
would not accept any such complimentary description.</p>

<p>"It is just my business point of view," he remarked drily. "Suppose
I put the value of the pictures at fifty thousand pounds. Personally I
would give double that amount for my life, though I should very much
doubt whether anybody else would give as many pence."</p>

<p>Laughter and tears strove for mastery in her face.</p>

<p>"You have greatly relieved my mind, Mr. Flurscheim,"
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
she said softly. "Though I shall never see
Mr. Hora again, yet Iâ€”I could not bear to think of him
in prison."</p>

<p>"You had better see him again, and quickly, too, if
you want to keep him out of it," snapped the Jew
promptly in response. "It will want a woman's hand to
do that, and from what I have observed you are about
the only person in the world who has half a chance of
succeeding."</p>

<p>The direct attack, voicing the thought she had striven to suppress,
brought the colour surging to her cheeks. "Don't you understand," she
cried. "He is a thiefâ€”a thief."</p>

<p>"He seems to be a rare plucky one anyway," answered Flurscheim.
Meriel laughed hysterically. "There! There! There!" said the
connoisseur in his most soothing manner, "I didn't mean to hurt you,
and I can see you are very much upset. Perhaps we will talk over this
bad business later and see what we can manage between us."</p>

<p>There was so much kindness in his manner, so real a delicacy in his
whole attitude, that Meriel felt more than ever inclined to confide the
whole story to him. He was a man of the world. He owed Guy a debt of
gratitude. She had not promised Guy to keep silence. He had never asked
her, for he had realised that the request would have been an insult.
There was little time to argue the matter with herself. Flurscheim was
impatient to depart. She obeyed the impulse.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flurscheim," she said, "will you treat what I
tell you as strictly confidential, and take no action without
my permission?"</p>

<p>"I give you my word," he said gravely.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>Meriel glanced round her. No living soul was in sight.
They stood alone upon the sea-wall. Flurscheim noted
her glance.</p>

<p>"There's no chance of being overheard," he remarked.
At a little distance was a stile in a rail fence which
separated one meadow from another. Flurscheim
pointed to it.</p>

<p>"Come along," he said brusquely, and there the girl
made known to her companion the story of Guy's life
as she had heard it from his lips.</p>

<p>"He is not so greatly to blame, is he, Mr. Flurscheim?"
she asked eagerly, when she had finished the
narration. "And yet nothing can alter the fact that he
is a thief."</p>

<p>The Jew had listened with growing amazement. To him the story seemed
the wildest, maddest romance he had ever heard. He could scarcely
believe his ears. To Meriel's appeal he could only reply at first with
an Hebraic invocation, uttered beneath his breath. Then he asked, "And
you really think he was telling the truth?"</p>

<p>"If you had seen his face, you would have had no need
to ask the question," she answered sorrowfully.</p>

<p>"It's the tallest story I've ever heard," he remarked. "But whether
true or not, if we want to do anything for him the first step is to get
him out of the hands of that old scoundrel of a father, and," he added,
"I am more than ever convinced that only a woman can do that. Think it
over, Miss Challys, think it over." He glanced at his watch. "Now if
you will give me his address, I will be off. I have a number of things
to do before returning to town."</p>

<p>She gave him the address. She responded heartily to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
his farewell, and as she stood watching him as he hastened along the
path towards the quay it seemed to her that already the burden of her
trouble was lightened. She trusted Flurscheim implicitly, and yet
twenty-four hours previously she would have been prepared to assert
that he would have been the last person in the world of whom she would
have taken counsel in her distress.</p>

<p>Not that her mind was at rest. She merely was relieved from anxiety
as regards Guy's immediate safety. As to the future there was no
trace of a silver lining to the clouds. Guy and she had parted. Yet
Flurscheim's words stuck in her brain. "Only a woman could help him."
Only a woman!

<small>INSPECTOR KENLY CONTEMPLATES ACTION</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Events were coiling themselves swiftly, and Lynton Hora at the very
centre of the coil was inert, motionless, unaware of the web which was
being spun about him. Indeed some of those various parties who were the
actors in the events, the puppets who had been set in motion by Hora's
initiative to spin the web for his own entwining, were unaware even
that they were spinning such a web.</p>

<p>But Inspector Kenly knew. He guessed that there must have been some
master mind behind Guy's exploits, and once he had fixed upon Lynton
Hora as the possessor of that master mind he was a sleuth hound on
the trail. Where Hora was, Kenly was not far distant. When Hora left
Westminster Mansions on the night of Guy's arrival, Kenly was at his
heels. He tracked him to a railway station, back from the railway
station to one of the big London hotels. He did not leave the premises
until Hora had retired for the night. Then he went back to Westminster
Mansions and learned of Guy's arrival there. He was very curious as
to the meaning of the movements of the two men. He could not watch
them both, and though he longed to have followed the business through
without assistance the risk had become too great. He went in haste to
Scotland Yard and requisitioned the assistance of a subordinate to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
watch the Mansions. He himself returned to the hotel. He was still more
astounded next morning when Hora returned quietly to his own abode, and
was totally unable to deduce anything from the fact that Guy had left
the flat at daybreak. It was so mysterious that he could not rest. He
went again to the Yard and asked for another man.</p>

<p>"I think I am on the track of the Flurscheim gang,"
he explained. "It's only a case of suspicion at present,
and I still have the Foreign Office business in hand."</p>

<p>"The Yard" was sore at its failure to solve the mystery of the
stolen picture, and a dozen men would have been at the Inspector's
command if he had so desired. He promised to explain later, saying that
the necessity for placing his men was urgent, and so he managed to keep
his information to himself. His instructions to his subordinates were
simple and explicit. Unseen themselves, one was to follow Lynton Hora,
the other was not to lose sight of Guy. If either of the two under
surveillance attempted to leave the country he was to be detained. The
warrant would be forthcoming if needed. Already the Inspector had his
information drawn out. But there were three names in that information,
and the third was that of Captain Marven.</p>

<p>His subordinates instructed in their duties, the detective hurried
off to the Foreign Office. Ever since the Permanent Secretary had
suggested asking Captain Marven for an explanation Kenly's mind had
been busy with the idea. Though he had been horror stricken at first,
the more he pondered over it, the more advantageous it seemed. Though
Captain Marven's name appeared in his unsworn information, he still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
doubted whether the King's Messenger could be hand in glove with the
Horas. If the suggested interview took place in his presence, he would
be able to judge by the Captain's demeanour as to whether he was in
any way implicated in the despatch business. If implicated in that,
there would be every reason to suspect that he must have had a hand
in the Flurscheim burglary. So he sought out the Permanent Secretary
and proffered his request. It met with a ready acceptance. "Captain
Marven," said the Secretary, "is next on the rota for service. If I had
not employed him, the mere fact would have caused comment as well as
arousing his suspicions, and I really could not have employed him while
this cloud is hanging over him."</p>

<p>"He will be expecting a call to town then?" asked Inspector Kenly.
"If he gets the usual notice he will be taken entirely by surprise on
finding why he has been summoned."</p>

<p>"I will wire for him, if you like," said the Permanent
Secretary.</p>

<p>"No," said the detective, "to-morrow will do."</p>

<p>"Then I'll have a letter sent to him in the ordinary way," said the
Permanent Secretary. "Of course, you understand," he continued, "that
we shall take no action in regard to the despatch business beyond
dispensing with Captain Marven's services. It would be fatal to our
diplomacy if the impression were to get abroad that any of our people
were not absolutely trustworthy."</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly looked aghast. "But, what if he is
concerned in the other business?" he asked. "Mustn't
he pay the penalty?"</p>

<p>"The penalty of twenty-four hours' law in which to
get out of England, with someone in charge of him to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
see that he does not communicate with the rest of the
gang," said the Permanent Secretary drily. "Exile will
be punishment enough in itself."</p>

<p>Inspector Kenly sighed. He saw his case robbed of one of its most
sensational features, and he loved to see sensational headlines to the
newspaper reports of the cases in which he was engaged. He left the
Foreign Office less elate than he had entered it, but, indefatigable
still, he visited each of his subordinates in turn. Neither had any
movement to report. Both Lynton Hora and Guy remained in their own
abodes. Kenly thought that he had earned a little repose. He got into
a cab, drove to the railway station, and took a train to Wimbledon. He
fell into a doze before the train started, and in his dreamy state he
thought longingly of white sheets which were awaiting him at Woodbine
Cottage. For forty-eight hours he had not closed his eyes. He felt
thoroughly wearied.</p>

<p>He alighted at his station and stepped out briskly
homewards. Then, as he turned into Melpomene Road,
he saw in front of him a figure which he recognised. He
was so surprised that he pinched himself to assure himself
that he was not dreaming.</p>

<p>"My friend Mr. Jessel, by Henry!" he remarked. "I
wonder what he is doing down in this quarter again."</p>

<p>He moderated his pace and followed Jessel until the latter, on
arriving at the gate of Woodbine Cottage, lifted the latch and entered.
By the time the Inspector had reached the gate Cornelius had knocked
at the door, and as Kenly raised the latch, Mrs. Inspector Kenly
appeared in answer to the summons of her late lodger. But Mrs. Kenly
paid no attention to her visitor. Her glance <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span> had travelled beyond him and rested
on her husband, whom she had not seen for a fortnight. She brushed
the astonished Cornelius aside and darted along the little path. The
shadow-man felt quite embarrassed by the warmth of the connubial
greeting. He called attention to his presence by a little cough. It
was successful. Kenly looked over his wife's shoulder and gave a well
feigned start of surprise.</p>

<p>"Blessed if it isn't our friend, Mr. Jessel," he remarked. "Who ever
would have thought of seeing you here again? Anyhow, I take it very
kindly your looking us up so soon. Come in, old chap, come in. You must
excuse the missus and me. I'm only just back from my little holiday,
you know. We don't do this sort of thing in the front garden every
night."</p>

<p>Mr. Jessel smiled and Mrs. Kenly opened her eyes widely. She had
never known her husband to be so effusive with a lodger, new or old.
But like a wise woman she said nothing, but, blushing a little,
seconded her husband's invitation.</p>

<p>"Ifâ€”if I had known you were expected," said Jessel
turning to Kenly, "I would have postponed my call for
an hour. Perhaps you will allow me to come back a
little later."</p>

<p>"Not at all," said Kenly heartily. "Come in and have
a cup of tea with us. I'm sure the wife will be proud to
give you one."</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenly opened her eyes wider than ever. She could very well have
dispensed with her late lodger's company, but she had suddenly realised
that her husband must have some hidden reason for his geniality. Had he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
not arrived at Jessel's very heels? Scenting a mystery she played up to
the Inspector's lead, and Jessel, visibly gratified by the warmth of
the greeting, no longer rejected the proffered hospitality. In a very
few minutes he was seated at the detective's table doing justice to the
delicacies which Mrs. Kenly produced from larder and cupboard in honour
of her lord's return.</p>

<p>He had soon revealed the motive for his call. He
wanted to know if the room he had occupied was still
unlet, for, if so, he desired, having suddenly lost his situation,
to return to the place where he had been so comfortable.
Mrs. Kenly hardly knew what to reply. She
was already in negotiation with another party. But her
inclination towards so quiet and well behaved a lodger
as Mr. Jessel, strengthened by the surreptitious nod of
approval from her husband, ultimately led to her declaring
that she thought the negotiations in progress
might be broken off and Mr. Jessel installed in his
former quarters.</p>

<p>Cornelius was delighted, and said so.</p>

<p>"I should like to come in this very night," he said. "I
have nowhere but an hotel to go to, and I never can sleep
at an hotel."</p>

<p>Again in obedience to her husband's mute request Mrs.
Kenly, after a decent amount of hesitation, acceded to
his wishes, and when the shadow-man at last left them
it was merely to fetch his baggage.</p>

<p>Mrs. Kenly accompanied the returned lodger to the
door, and when she returned to the parlour she found
that her husband had disappeared.</p>

<p>"Well, I do think he is not treating me quite fairly,"
she murmured, and unaccustomed tears rose to her eyes.
But they dried rapidly as she heard a thud on the floor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
of the room overhead and recognised the fall of a boot.
She hastened upstairs and found her husband already
half-undressed.</p>

<p>"Whatever in the world is the matter, Joe?" she asked.
Inspector Kenly grunted.</p>

<p>"Can't keep my eyes open any longer, not if you were
to prop up the lids with steel bars, Loo," he answered.</p>

<p>His eyes were not so closely shut, however, that they
were unable to detect the disappointment which was expressed
in his wife's face. He caught her in his arms
and imprinted a couple of kisses on her lips.</p>

<p>"I haven't had a wink of sleep for forty-eight hours,"
he said, "and I only wish I could do without for another
forty-eight. But a nap while I get the chance will make
another man of me. Now listen, Loo. What time did
Jessel say he was coming back?"</p>

<p>"He said he was afraid that it would not be much before
midnight," replied Mrs. Kenly.</p>

<p>"Give me a call at 11.30, then," said Inspector Kenly,
and he tumbled into bed and gave a huge sigh of relief.
Then he raised his head. "If he gets back earlier call
me."</p>

<p>"But what makes you so interested in Mr. Jessel?"
she asked, unable any longer to restrain her curiosity.</p>

<p>"Come here, Loo," said Kenly, and as his wife drew
near he whispered, "That young man is mixed up in
some way with the Flurscheim burglary. No, don't interrupt.
I haven't time to tell you all about it, and that
is much more than I ought to have told you. Now you
know why I was so anxious that you should get him
back here."</p>

<p>"But suppose he doesn't come back," said Mrs. Kenly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>"He will come back right enough," answered the detective
drowsily as he laid his head again upon the pillow.</p>

<p>"But," said Mrs. Kenly, and then paused. Her husband's
eyes had closed. His mouth was slightly open.
In another few seconds an unmistakable snore made itself
heard. Mrs. Kenly drew the blinds and noiselessly
withdrew downstairs. She was excited, but not too excited
to neglect her ordinary duties.</p>

<p>The hours passed slowly. When ten and eleven had
gone without any sign of Jessel she began to be alarmed.
Still he had said he might not be back until midnight.
At half past eleven she aroused her husband, thoughtfully
taking with her a cup of tea. He was sleeping so
soundly that she was compelled to shake him before he
could be aroused. She had just succeeded when the
sound of a cab drawing up in the street outside the garden
gate arrested her attention. Kenly heard it too, and
sprang out of bed.</p>

<p>"Keep him talking until I come down," he said.</p>

<p>The next minute the modest knock at the door announced
Jessel's arrival, and Mrs. Kenly hurried downstairs
to let him in.</p>

<p>"Half afraid I should have found you all in bed," he
said as he entered. "You don't mind leaving the door
open while I fetch my bags?"</p>

<p>By the time he had made two journeys to the cab
Inspector Kenly was standing by his wife's side, and he
was inviting the shadow-man to join him in a nightcap
before retiring to rest.</p>

<p>Cornelius was agreeable. He followed his host into
the tiny parlour where Mrs. Kenly produced a bottle and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
glasses from the sideboard and a jug of hot water and a
lemon from the kitchen.</p>

<p>"It's just like coming 'ome," said Jessel.</p>

<p>"We'll make you feel at home here, right enough," replied
the Inspector.</p>

<p>When a little later Mrs. Kenly said good-night and retired
Jessel felt so much at home indeed that he was
easily persuaded to take "just one more" before following
her example. He grew quite talkative, yet even
under the detective's skilful guidance he could not be led
to speak upon the one subject which his host was anxious
to get him to talk about. Kenly was afraid to put leading
questions lest he should become alarmed too early.</p>

<p>There was a time for all things, however, and the time
came when the Inspector thought it desirable that his
companion should receive a shock. It arrived when,
after Jessel had knocked the ashes out of his pipe and
remarked that he thought it was about time to turn in.</p>

<p>"There's one thing I want to ask you first," remarked
the detective quietly. "Who was the old gentleman,
got up like a parson, who came to visit you here?"</p>

<p>The shot told. Jessel grew suddenly pale and his jaw
dropped. "Old gentleman? What old gentleman?" he
stammered.</p>

<p>Kenly did not reply immediately. He walked across
the room and deliberately turned the key in the lock
and placed the key in his pocket. Then returning he
took a card from his waistcoat pocket and laid it on the
table before his companion.</p>

<p>"You don't seem to be aware who I am, Jessel," he
said pleasantly.</p>

<p>Mechanically Cornelius lifted up the card, and as he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
read his face grew longer than ever. He laid the card
on the table. Kenly, noticing his shaking hand, smiled.</p>

<p>"Detective Inspector Kenly from Scotland Yard,"
said Cornelius, as if bewildered.</p>

<p>"That's me," declared Kenly. "And I mean to have
an answer to the question I have just asked you." Jessel's
confusion was almost pitiable to witness. The mine
that had been sprung upon him took his breath away.
To think that he had been a tenant of a member of the
detective force, sleeping under the same roof, and that
the Master had come to see him there was too preposterous
to be believed.</p>

<p>"Youâ€”you're joking," he stammered at last.</p>

<p>"Not the least little bit in the world, as you will find
out to your cost, Mr. Jessel, if you don't answer my questions,"
replied Kenly readily. Then he added, "I know
all about you, so I really think it will be best for you to
meet me in a friendly way."</p>

<p>Cornelius remembered a dozen little schemes of his
which had brought him in cash which would not bear the
light of day, and his heart quailed. He never for a moment
imagined that Kenly was merely bluffing. Still he
made an effort in his own defence.</p>

<p>"Youâ€”you know nothing against me," he asserted.
"Iâ€”I've never done anything wrong." His tone and
manner gave the lie to his assertion, and Kenly began to
feel on safe ground.</p>

<p>"You may not think so, but I'm quite sure a magistrate
would not agree with you," said Kenly with conviction.
"Still I don't suggest testing the matter if you will tell
me what I want to know."</p>

<p>Cornelius saw no means of escape. He surrendered at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
discretion, and when the conference was ended the detective
was in possession of the whole story of the shadow-man's
connection with Guy Hora from the moment when
he had been employed by "the Master" to watch over
him until that day when Guy had suddenly paid him a
month's wages and bidden him depart at once.</p>

<p>Long after the conference was ended the detective
brooded over the information which had come into his
possession. He could not understand it. Jessel was
manifestly unaware of the identity of the man he called
"The Master" with Lynton Hora. Nor could he suggest
any reason why Guy should have so suddenly dispensed
with his services. The detective did not enlighten
Cornelius on the first point, nor did he suggest
that the second fact might have been due to some discovery
made by Guy that the casket containing the stolen
miniature had been tampered with. Jessel had revealed
everything, even the momentous discovery he had made,
the discovery he had communicated to Mr. Hildebrand
Flurscheim.</p>

<p>Kenly tired of puzzling his brain after a while with
theories. He made his way once more up to his bedroom
and resumed the sleep from which he had been awakened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV<br>
<small>THE PARTING OF THE WAYS</small>
</h2></div>

<p>A minute after Guy had peeped into her bedroom
Myra awakened. Her sleep had been short and she
awoke unrefreshed. She arose mechanically and was
surprised that her maid was not there, that her bath was
not ready. She looked at a clock and saw that the hour
was not yet five. She lay down again upon her bed and
watched the clouds chasing each other across the sky.
She fell to counting them as they crossed her field of
vision, bounded by the two sides of the window frame.
In the first hour there were seventy-two, between six
and seven, twenty-one, between seven and eight, only
three. When the maid came at half past eight the sky
had been untarnished for a whole half hour.</p>

<p>She told the girl to make the bath hot. The hot water
was very comforting. She found a physical satisfaction
in the caress of the warm water. As a child she had always
delighted in her bath. She recalled her childish delight.
Anything to keep thought at bay.</p>

<p>After the bath she dressed slowly. The maid was exasperated,
but Myra was quite heedless of the fact. The
day was hardly begun, and there were so many hours in
the day to be filled somehow with anything that would
stave off thought. At eleven she ordered breakfast and
sat down alone to it. The dishes went away untouched.
She took a newspaper into the drawing-room, but she got
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
no further than the door. It was there Guy had rejected
the love she had offered him. She had no feeling
of shame, only she could not remain there. She went
instead to Lynton Hora's study. The room awakened
another thought. What would the Commandatore say?
He had told her to keep Guy, and Guy had gone. She remembered
Hora's unuttered threat, but she had not great
fear of his anger. Still she knew he would be angry,
for Guy had offered to marry her, and she had refused
the offer. It was not marriage she wanted, only to be
loved, and she was compelled to refuse. But the Commandatore
would blame her, for Guy had gone. Her
lips drooped at the thought. Her spirit was broken.</p>

<p>Lynton Hora returned. She heard his step in the
hall, the firm footstep followed by the shuffle of his
lamed leg. But she did not attempt to move. He came
straight to his own room. She did not even glance up
as he entered.</p>

<p>"Where's Guy?" His voice was harsh.</p>

<p>"Gone," she replied without lifting her eyes.</p>

<p>For a minute no other word was spoken. Hora paced
the room, up and down from door to window, and every
time he turned to face Myra the scowl on his face deepened.
Her manifest distress awakened no pity in him.
He even marvelled that he had ever thought her beautiful.
Her face was dull and expressionless, the lustre had
gone from her hair, her figure drooped despondently.
She recalled to his mind a dropsical old woman, clad in
rags, with a palsied hand grasping at a bottle of gin in a
dilapidated outhouse in Fancy Lane.</p>

<p>"When is he coming back?" he snarled again.</p>

<p>"Never."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Did her lips fashion the word? She had no warrant
for making so definite a reply, but she knew that it was
true.</p>

<p>Hora's anger nearly loosened a torrent of invective.
But he refrained. What was the use? Myra had failed.
Guy was lost to him. She was of no use to him now.</p>

<p>"If Guy has gone, you had better take yourself off,
too," he said deliberately.</p>

<p>She did not appear to hear him, and he repeated the
command with growing irritation.</p>

<p>He was surprised to see the tears trickle down her
cheeks and the corners of her mouth turn downwards.
There had been no snivelling about Myra in the past.</p>

<p>"I could not help Guy going. He does not love me,"
she said meekly.</p>

<p>Hora's scorn could no longer be restrained. "Love,"
he sneered. "The world is mad on the subject, the besotted
idiocy of immature brains. Because a girl would
and a boy won't a man's plans and schemes are to be
wrecked. I'll be alone in future. You can take yourself
off as soon as you like."</p>

<p>"Where am I to go?" she asked.</p>

<p>Hora shrugged his shoulders. "You have the whole
world to choose from," he sneered. "Go where you
like; your native gutter is about the only place which is
really suitable, but I don't care where you go so long as
you do not cross my path again."</p>

<p>For the first time Myra looked up. She met his glance,
and so fierce an anger blazed in his eyes that a thrill of
physical fear passed through her. Had she been in her
normal condition the anger would have awakened an
answering flame in herself. But she was broken in spirit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
She shrank from meeting his anger. She rose listlessly
from her chair and went out of the room. She supposed
that she must obey. She had always obeyed Hora. But
it was very hard to be turned out thus. Where to go?
That was a difficult question to decide at a moment's
notice. Perhaps the Commandatore was right, and that
her proper place was the gutter. The Commandatore
was usually right.</p>

<p>She gathered together some of her jewels, and dressed
herself in one of her smartest frocks. She had a vague
idea that she was doing unwisely, but the bright colour
attracted her. Her brain had room for only one thought.
She pinned on her hat carefully and went quietly out.
She did not cast one glance backwards. The bracelet
Guy had had made for her from the stones which had
originally encircled the miniature was still clasped upon
her arm.</p>

<p>Hora saw her leave, but he made no effort to check
her. He had not intended to turn her from his door, and
noting the frock and the hat he was quite easy in his
mind. "She will return," he said to himself, and
straightway began to think of Guy. If Guy was never
going to return, Hora foresaw that he must seek him
out. He acted upon the decision at once, and drove away
to the Albany. He still had belief in his own powers of
persuasion. The thought of using Guy as a tool for his
revenge had passed entirely out of his mind. He wanted
nothing but that Guy, the son of his adoption, should
come back to him.</p>

<p>At the Albany he arrived to find the newly furnished
chambers in confusion. Guy himself opened the door
to admit him. He did not appear surprised at the visit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>Hora enquired why Guy had answered the door himself.</p>

<p>"I've got rid of my man," said Guy.</p>

<p>"Retrenchment?" asked the Commandatore.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Guy.</p>

<p>"I don't see the necessity," said Hora.</p>

<p>"I do," answered Guy with gravity.</p>

<p>Hora had followed him into the sitting-room and
stood there expectantly. "Why?" he asked pointedly.</p>

<p>Guy hesitated. There was so much to explain that he
did not know where to begin. Hora's next question did
not make his task easier.</p>

<p>"Myra tells me that you have deserted us, is it true?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"I can hardly say definitely. The answer in all probability
will not rest with me," replied Guy.</p>

<p>He realised suddenly the whimsicality of the position
in which he was momentarily placedâ€”the position of defending
himself from the charge of refusing to continue
a criminal existence. The thought won a smile from his
lips.</p>

<p>"You cannot tell me?" said Hora. "Have you considered
thoroughly?" He stepped forward and laid his
hand on the young man's arm. "Have you considered
what such a decision would mean to me, Guy? I am getting
on in years. You have always been with me. I
might go far to meet your wishes, even to the extent of
abandoning my profession, if I could keep you with me."</p>

<p>"It would not be enough." Guy's answer was stern
and hard.</p>

<p>Hora was startled by the tone. "What more can you
require?" he asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span></p>

<p>"What more?" said Guy bitterly. "What more?"
His face flushed and he held up his hand. "Atonement,"
he replied, "atonement for the past."</p>

<p>There was accusation in Guy's tone, and Hora shrank
under it, but he rallied his wits. "Why so melodramatic?"
he sneered.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know it sounds ridiculous in your ears," he
answered, "but I see no other way of regaining my own
self-esteem." He turned fiercely on Hora. "Why did
you bring me up differently from other boys? Why did
you, day by day, week by week, and year by year, instil
into my ears your lying philosophy? Why did you make
your son a thiefâ€”a thief?"</p>

<p>All the concentrated bitterness of Guy's musings was
infused into the concluding words. Hora's lips grew
pale and his hands trembled as he listened. He recognised
the emotion from which Guy suffered by the memory
of his own experience when he had himself been
branded in the light of day and the sight of all men.
Still he strove to meet the point of view.</p>

<p>"I thought you had learned to place their true value
upon conventional terms," he remarked.</p>

<p>"I have," said Guy, more bitterly than before. "I
have learned that a thief is a thief whatever sophistry
may be used to throw a glamour of romance over his
actions."</p>

<p>"I never taught you otherwise," remarked Hora,
"only that all men are thieves, only that the hypocritical
many steal under the cloak of the law, and the intellectually
honest few pursue their avocation in defiance of the
law. Why reproach yourself for intellectual honesty?"</p>

<p>Guy made no reply and Hora plunged into argument.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
"What is theft? Merely the acquisition of the desirable
by unconventional means. Is it a virtue to gratify
your desire by the same process as the dull souls that are
presumably dignified by the name of common humanity?
If so, virtue is a mere synonym for mediocrity. I thought
you knew better, Guy. I thought that you had learned
that man owes his chief duty to himself, that his desires
are meant to be gratified, that the most courageous way
of gratifying his desires is the only way for man to attain
his highest development."</p>

<p>He pursued the theme with animation. Guy had
seated himself, leaning his head on his hand. Hora
thought that his attitude was one of deep attention. When
he paused for breath Guy spoke:</p>

<p>"It is of no use, Commandatore. I have gone over the
same arguments with myself a hundred times, but I can
no longer persuade myself that they are anything but
sheer sophistry."</p>

<p>Lynton Hora shrugged his shoulders. "I don't understand
why your opinions should have undergone so sudden
a change."</p>

<p>"And yet you have known a good woman's love?"
said Guy suddenly.</p>

<p>The remark stung. Hora's eyes flashed and his lips
closed tightly for a few seconds before he trusted himself
to speak.</p>

<p>"So that's the explanation," he said at last. "I
thought as much. A woman is responsible for every
man's folly, and you like the rest are ready to abuse
your intellect at the bidding of some muling miss whose
intelligence will never allow her to discern the asses'
ears which adorn the image of the great divinity convention
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
which she worships in common with the majority
of her feeble-minded fellows. Who is this wonder
who has robbed you of the use of your brains? Am
I right in guessing that she is of the family of that
prince of hypocrites, Marven? I can see I am right.
And for one of that brood you will cut yourself adrift
from me, clothe yourself in the ready-made fustian of
the dull herd! An honest woman's love! There was
never an honest woman to be found amongst the
Challys or Marvensâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>His anger had carried him out of himself, and too
late Hora perceived that his virulent tongue had said
too much.</p>

<p>Guy had drawn himself up, pale with anger.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "I must ask you to leave me to myself.
I cannot listen to abuse of one who is more to me
than anyone else in the world."</p>

<p>Hora strove to undo the effect of his words. "Chivalrous
as ever, Guy," he remarked quietly, though despite
his intention a sneer curled his lips at what appeared to
him a ridiculous exhibition of sentimentalism.</p>

<p>Guy did not reply to the taunt. He continued steadily:</p>

<p>"I must ask you to leave me, yet before you go, I will
give you fair warning of my intentions. You have
learned of the alteration in my opinions. I have told you
that only by atonement shall I feel that I can regain my
self-esteem. There is only one atonement I can make."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hora breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I intend to surrender myself to justice," said Guy,
"within the next forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>Lynton Hora was stunned. The utter madness of the
idea left him bereft of the power of speech for a moment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
and when the capacity returned to him he could
only think of one argument.</p>

<p>"You are not reckoning on Meriel Challys marrying
you when you have 'atoned,' as you call it," he said.</p>

<p>Guy shook his head. "I have no hope," he said
wearily. "Good-bye, Commandatore."</p>

<p>Hora made no answer. He knew that it was useless
to argue with Guy any longer. The set of his lips, the
angle of his jaw, the quietude with which he made the
announcement were eloquent of determination. The
door closed behind him and he went out into the street
as one dazed. The first, a merely momentary impulse,
was to leave Guy to his own devices. But that passed.
He became possessed by fearâ€”an overpowering fear of
imminent danger to himself. He judged rightly that
Guy's chivalry, the chivalry which was leading him to
sacrifice himself to an ideal, would equally compel him
to keep silence in regard to his confederate. But Guy's
silence would not protect him if enquiries were pushed
home in regard to either of the two adventures in which
Guy had taken part. Lynton Hora knew that he could
not escape suspicion, and suspicion once awakened he
knew that his career would come to an end. There
loomed before his mind the long days of dull routine,
the still longer nights behind the locked doors, the coarse
food of the prison, the horrible convict dress. Furtively
he looked over his shoulder, for it seemed to him
that a hand was almost outstretched to grasp him.</p>

<p>Pooh! There was nobody taking any notice of him.
The pleasant-featured, sunburnt man who passed him
at the moment could have no idea whose sleeve he had
brushed. The Master crushed down his fear. Guy must
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
be protected against himself, and there was no time to
waste. A lunatic asylum? Certainly Guy was mad
enough for one. But there would be many difficulties
to be surmounted, and time was short. Hora's mind became
active as it always did under stress of necessity.
Was there no one who could prevail upon Guy to forego
his intention, no argument which would appeal to him?
Stay. There was one which might succeed. Supposing
Guy were to learn his real parentage.</p>

<p>Lynton Hora hastened his steps. He saw one chance of saving Guy from
the consequences of his folly, of saving himself also, and at the same
time paying his debt of hatred. Captain Marven assuredly would never
allow his son to consign himself to a gaol. Guy would be too chivalrous
to smirch the fair fame of a family to which Meriel belonged. With his
mind dwelling on this expedient, Hora looked behind him no more. He
was not aware that the man with the sunburnt face kept him steadily
in view until he disappeared into his own abode. He did not suspect
that Detective Inspector Kenly, for he was the man who had brushed his
sleeve, waited patiently until he reappeared again and followed him
discreetly until he knocked at the door of Captain Marven's town house.
The Inspector only saw in that fact one additional piece of evidence
of Marven's guilty connection with the Horas. He saw that Hora put a
package into the hands of the servant who opened the door, and he made
a mental note of the fact. He guessed that the King's Messenger had
arrived in town in obedience to the summons which had been sent him,
and he assumed that he had communicated the fact of his arrival to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
Hora. Still at the heels of his quarry he returned again to Westminster
Mansions, and there he transferred the duty to one of his subordinates.
The hour was two in the afternoon, and at three he was to be a fourth
at the interview between Captain Marven and the Great Man and the
Permanent Secretary at the Foreign Office.

<small>CAPTAIN MARVEN'S SURPRISE PACKET</small>
</h2></div>

<p>When in response to the official summons Captain Marven returned to
town he was more perturbed than he would have cared to confess, at the
disastrous ending to Meriel's love affair. The intimacy of everyday
life had only confirmed the favourable impression Guy had produced
upon him, and he had looked forward with pleasure to welcoming him as
a member of his family. But altogether apart from the question of his
own gratification, he was deeply pained that a cloud should have cast
its shadow on the girl's happiness, and he be able to do nothing to
dissipate it. He was in that condition of mind when trifles are apt to
irritate the best conditioned of men, and he was consequently as nearly
discourteous as it was possible for him to be when Mr. Hildebrand
Flurscheim thrust himself into the same compartment of the railway
train. As a travelling companion Flurscheim was the last person in the
world he would have chosen, and he strove to ignore his presence by
burying himself in a newspaper.</p>

<p>But Flurscheim was not accustomed to be ignored.
He took no notice of Marven's coolness, but chattered
away incessantly, and at last he succeeded in capturing
the Captain's attention.</p>

<p>"There seems to have been some trouble between the
young people," he had remarked.</p>

<p>"Really, I cannot conceive that if there is it can be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
any business of yours, Mr. Flurscheim," replied Marven
frigidly.</p>

<p>The Jew had taken no notice of the snub.</p>

<p>"I'm not so sure of that," he had answered. "I am
not so sure but that I may not be successful in putting
matters straight between them."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you driving at?" asked the Captain.</p>

<p>Flurscheim smiled. "It's not a matter I can talk about," he
answered, "without the permission of others, but I've seen how
interested you are in Mr. Guy Hora, and I've put my own construction
on your looking a bit down in the mouth this morning. I hope you'll
excuse me speaking straight what's in my mind, and if I'm mistaken,
I apologise for my interference. That's my impression, anyway," he
continued, as Captain Marven did not reply, "so I thought that I would
tell you that I think I know what is troubling Mr. Hora, and that I
also think it is in my power to clear up the trouble. Of course, I may
be mistaken, but I hope I am not, for I owe your young friend a debt I
can never hope fully to repay."</p>

<p>He spoke so earnestly that Marven's reserve and irritation
melted away, and the two men parted at the London
terminus on the best of terms with each other.</p>

<p>But although Marven had not learned anything as to
the nature of Flurscheim's intended action he felt easier
in his mind, for he realised that the Jew was very much
in earnest, and he drove off to his town house to make
his preparations for his anticipated journey with a far
lighter heart than he had possessed when leaving Whitsea.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span></p>

<p>These preparations were soon completed, and he was
sitting down to a hastily prepared luncheon when Lynton
Hora had knocked at his door. Hora had not anticipated
finding Captain Marven in town, but had
merely called in order to ascertain with certainty where
the letter he had written would find him. Then
finding that Marven was in the house, he had left the
packet with instructions that it was to be immediately
delivered.</p>

<p>The package Hora had left was a bulky one. Marven merely glanced at
it when the servant brought it to him. Not until he had finished lunch
did he cut the string. When the wrapper was unfolded and he had shaken
out the contents his face paled, and he gasped for breath. There seemed
but little reason for his agitation; the parcel contained nothing but a
child's pinafore and a letter. Yet the sight of the pinafore was quite
sufficient to blur his vision and set his hands shaking. He recognised
it. He knew it instantly, without the necessity for turning to the
corner where the letters G. M. were embroidered by his wife's own hand.
He sprang to his feet and rang the bell violently.</p>

<p>"Where is the man who brought this parcel?" he demanded directly
the servant who had waited on him made her appearance. His anxiety
was so great that the woman was terrified, and some minutes elapsed
before he could obtain from her a connected account of Hora's call.
She seemed to think she must have been in some way to blame for
receiving the package. Marven succeeded ultimately in reassuring her,
and sent her out hastily to see if the messenger still lingered in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
neighbourhood. He followed to the door and was grievously disappointed
when she declared that he was nowhere to be seen. Bethinking himself of
the unopened letter he returned to the room where he had left it. The
envelope was similar to many which had reached him previously, on the
anniversary of his child's disappearance, but when he opened it he saw
that it contained much more than the three-lined typed message telling
him that his child was alive. There were many sheets of note paper
covered in a bold handwriting which seemed familiar to him. His hand
shook more than ever as he smoothed out the sheets, and his eyes grew
dim again. Was his son at last to be restored to him? He laid down the
letter deliberately, and not until he had succeeded in mastering his
emotion did he attempt to make himself acquainted with the contents.
The opening sentence made his heart leap with joy. The epistle opened
baldly, without any of the customary methods of address.</p>

<p>"The time has arrived when I am compelled to restore
your son to you. I hope you will be proud of him.
He is known to the world as Guy Hora."</p>

<p>Then his instinct had been right. Guy was his son.
He wanted to read no more. That was quite enough.
He would hasten to make himself known to his son. He
rang the bell and ordered the servant to summon a cab
immediately. He would send a wire to his wife informing
her of the good news. He picked up the pinafore,
folded it carefully and placed it in his pocket. The letter
he could read on his way to Guy's chambers. But first he
would see if his correspondent revealed himself. He
turned to the last page. Yes, there was a signature,
"Hartley Ruthven, now known as Lynton Hora."</p>

<p>He remembered his brother officer and unsuccessful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
rival perfectly. He had thought, like all the rest of the world,
Ruthven had been dead years since. The reason for his child's
disappearance ceased to be a mystery any longer. Yet why should Ruthven
now desire to return to life? A sudden dread seized upon Marven as
he remembered his old comrade's cold, revengeful nature, the nature
which had been the real reason for his unpopularity in the regiment,
instead of the possession of narrow means, to which Hora had always
ascribed it. Perhaps this letter was only a part of Ruthven's revenge
upon the successful rival. Perhaps he had better read it to the end
before starting in search of Guy. He passed through the entire gamut
of the emotions before he had come to the end of the epistle. Hora
had deliberately set himself to describe Guy's history in plain,
matter-of-fact terms. He gave details of the manner of the kidnapping
of the child and particulars concerning him which left no doubt that he
was writing the truth. Then he went on to relate how from the first he
had trained Guy to a criminal career. Captain Marven's heart was eaten
out with rage, and he swore to himself that the sun should not set
before he exacted a reckoning from his enemy.</p>

<p>Hora wrote of Guy's university career, and as he read
Marven's heart expanded again with joy. His boy had
apparently been uninjured by his earlier education. He
thanked God for that. Then came two pages in which
Hora related the episodes of the Flurscheim robbery and
of the despoiling of himself of the despatches entrusted to
him. "The latter was an unpremeditated link in my
chain of revenge," wrote Hora. "Fortune does not always
favour the virtuous." The paper became blank to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
Marven's eyes. The servant who came to announce that
the cab was waiting at the door had to speak twice before
she could make her master comprehend.</p>

<p>The cabman must wait until he had finished the letter.
He read on.</p>

<p>"You will naturally ask why I am telling these facts now. I have
two reasons. Fortune has deserted me at last. I had intended to reveal
Guy's parentage when he stood in the dock so deeply stained with crime
that part of the odium he incurred would necessarily fall upon you.
More recently I determined that I would refrain from putting that
coping stone on the edifice of my revenge. Not out of any misplaced
tenderness for you. Do not think that. My reason was a purely selfish
one. My adopted son had somehow endeared himself to me. I foresaw in
him an ornament to my own profession. I became sentimental and so,
foolish. I thought he should always remain my son. I forgot that he
had your blood in his veins and I let him fall under your influence.
I forgot too that a girl can shatter the most complete philosophy
with a glance of her eyes. The young fool has fallen in love with
Meriel Challys, and the consequence is that he has got into his head a
ridiculous idea that he must deliver himself up to justice in order to
make amends for his legitimate spoiling of the Egyptians, Flurscheim
and yourself. He is proposing to do so within the next forty-eight
hours, so you may have time to prevent his voluntary martyrdomâ€”a
martyrdom he will certainly regret, judging from my own experience. Do
not think, however, that I am only animated by Guy's interests. I am
still keenly alive to my own safety. I have had quite enough of prison
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
life, and am well prepared with means of escape, though I do not desire
to end my existence just yet. Of course, if you care to sacrifice your
son in order that I shall not escape, that is your affair. Guy knows
nothing of his parentage, though I have taken steps to inform him of
it should you fail to do so. I shall not leave him entirely in your
hands."</p>

<p>Captain Marven laid the letter down, and, dropping his face in his
hands, he groaned aloud. His heart was sick with anguish. His long lost
son was returned to him, but in what guise? By training, by profession,
he was a thief. Guy Marven, his son, a thief! The horror of it was
almost too great to be borne! It was the bitterest blow of his life,
far more bitter even than the blow which had fallen when his baby boy
had been stolen from him. If Lynton Hora could have watched the effect
produced by his communication, even his thirst for revenge would have
been satisfied. But more bitter even than the knowledge of what his
son had become was the realisation of the burden of duty which the
revelation thrust upon him. As he realised his duty in the matter,
Captain Marven's face was grey with anguish. He had found his son only
to lose him againâ€”to lose him amongst the yellow-garbed denizens of
the convict prison. More, it was he who must, with his own hand, send
him to that outer darkness. God grant that his son would be a man! God
grant it! That was Captain Marven's earnest prayer.</p>

<p>Then his wife and Meriel? What if they were to learn
of Guy's relationship. Captain Marven could only dimly
conceive the effect upon them.</p>

<p>The servant came again to announce that the cab was awaiting
him. Marven rose, but it was as a man ten <span class="pagenum"
id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span> years older than the one who had opened
Hora's letter ten minutes before. His face was lined, and his hand
tremulous, but his lips were set firmly. He saw his duty plainly before
him. There was only one path he could tread, even though every step on
that path gave him a fresh pang. But he must see Guy first, before he
took that step.</p>

<p>He entered the cab and was driven to the Albany. He
was more master of himself by the time he arrived. He
wondered what he should do if Guy should be absent
from home, for the time at his command was short.
Within an hour he was due at the Foreign Office.</p>

<p>Guy opened the door, and started with amazement at
sight of his visitor's face.</p>

<p>"Captain Marven!" he exclaimed. Then a great fear
took possession of him. "Meriel?" he gasped.</p>

<p>Marven grasped the intention of the query.</p>

<p>"Meriel was all right when I left her this morning,"
he replied.</p>

<p>Guy's relief was obvious. "Are you ill? Is anything
the matter?" he asked, as he closed the door behind the
Captain, and followed him into his sitting-room.</p>

<p>Marven was at a loss for words. Hora's letter was in
his hand. He held it out to Guy, and said huskily, "Read
this."</p>

<p>"Butâ€”â€”" interrupted Guy.</p>

<p>"No, read this," repeated Marven.</p>

<p>Guy took the letter. He recognised the handwriting,
and he wondered. His wonder gave place to amazement
as he read. Amazement was succeeded by horror, and,
when he had finished reading, the paper dropped from
his hands, and he turned his face away from the man
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
who had brought it, in a vain endeavour to conceal his
emotion. He was hardly aware that a hand was laid
on his arm, until a voice, tremulous with emotion, said,
"Guy, my son."</p>

<p>He disdained concealment then. He wheeled round
and clutched blindly at the two hands outstretched to
meet his own.</p>

<p>"Father, forgive! forgive!" he muttered brokenly.

<small>DUTY CALLS</small>
</h2></div>

<p>All too swiftly speeded the minutes which were at Captain
Marven's disposal. There was so much to be explained,
so much to be learned, and barely an hour to
explain everything. Yet, short as the time, it was broken
in upon by the arrival of another visitor. For the second
time that day Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim found himself
thrusting his company upon persons who had little desire
for it. When he knocked at the door of Guy's chambers
Guy at first ignored the summons. But the knocking
persisted. He was forced to open the door, if only to
prevent his neighbours being disturbed, and, when once
the door was open, Flurscheim refused to be excluded.</p>

<p>"I must see you privately at once," declared the connoisseur.
"My business is of the utmost importance."</p>

<p>Guy admitted him into the sitting-room, where the
sight of Captain Marven surprised him into an exclamation.</p>

<p>"I must see you aloneâ€”quite alone," he insisted to
Guy.</p>

<p>"I would rather you did not," said Guy. "I am
afraid there is nothing you can say which will be news
to Captain Marven."</p>

<p>Flurscheim looked from the young man to the elder
man, and his shrewd eyes noted the emotion from which
both were obviously suffering.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>"It's my misfortune to have arrived at an inopportune
time," he remarked. "But you shall soon be rid of my
presence. I only want to rid myself of the debt I owe
you for preserving my life."</p>

<p>Guy's face flushed. He felt exquisitely uncomfortable.</p>

<p>"You rate my service too highly," he said. "I did
nothing which entailed any risk to myself, andâ€”â€”"
Flurscheim interrupted, but Guy continued hastily, "And
yet, perhaps, it is as well that you should have arrived
just now, while Captain Marven is here. I have a confession
to make to you. I should like him to hear what
I have to say andâ€”and, when I have said it, I think you
will no longer consider yourself in my debt."</p>

<p>The connoisseur found it difficult to believe his ears.
Guy's words could only bear one meaning. He glanced
at Captain Marven and saw that a light had come into
his face. Marven had grasped Guy's arm, and Flurscheim
heard him say,</p>

<p>"That's right, Guy, get it over."</p>

<p>Guy turned to him. There was a new-born humility
in his voice and manner. "It is really your wish?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"My wish is that my son should do his duty," replied
Marven sadly.</p>

<p>Guy threw back his head and faced the Jew.</p>

<p>"Mr. Flurscheim," he said, "I am the thief who stole
your picture."</p>

<p>Father and son were astounded at the result of the
bold confession. They had expected amazement, probably
immediate denunciation, but, instead, the Jew threw
up his hands deprecatingly, and fussily remarked:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
"There, there, there. What if you did? I could very
well afford the loss, couldn't I?"</p>

<p>Guy stared. He thought that he was not believed,
that, possibly, Flurscheim imagined that he had taken
leave of his senses.</p>

<p>"But it is true, Mr. Flurscheim. Iâ€”Guy Horaâ€”stole
your pictures. See, I can give you proof."</p>

<p>He turned to a little silver-bound casket lying on the
table, and took from it the miniature which was so like
Meriel. He cast one longing glance at the portrait as
he handed it to the connoisseur.</p>

<p>"Well, what if you did steal my picture," snapped
Flurscheim, "there is no need to inform the whole world
of the fact, is there?"</p>

<p>Guy was bewildered.</p>

<p>"I shall say no more about it," continued Flurscheim,
"except to advise you to keep that miniature out of the
sight of prying eyes, and to take the earliest opportunity
of getting rid of that dâ€”â€”d scoundrel of a valet of
yours."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Flurscheim," said Guy, "you do not seem
to comprehend, Iâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>The situation trembled on the verge of farce. The
Jew's eyes twinkled with amusement, but he grew grave
as he saw Captain Marven's haggard face.</p>

<p>"Let me explain, Mr. Hora," he said. "A few days
ago your man Jessel gave me information of this miniature
being in your possession. That same afternoon
while I was planning how to punish you, I fell overboard
and you saved my life. Now, you tell me, you were the
actual robber of the picture and other little articles. Well,
in return you presented me with something I value still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
more. Shall we call it a deal, and shake hands
on it?"</p>

<p>Guy could barely see the outstretched hand. A mist
was before his eyes.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I can appreciate your generosity," he said,
as he and the Jew grasped hands, "and perhaps, if I
could have restored you the articles I have stolen, I
might have listened. But there is another concerned.
I must share the penalty he will have to pay."</p>

<p>"There may be a hundred concerned. I'll not trouble
any of 'em, if I should hurt you by so doing. Come, Mr.
Hora, say it's a deal. Don't think you're accepting a
favour. It's all the other way about, so you needn't let
your pride stand in the way."</p>

<p>"Pride!" remarked Guy. "My pride has gone before
my fall." He was silent. A few hours previously
he would eagerly have accepted Flurscheim's offer, but
since he had read Hora's letter to Captain Marven, the
whole position was changed. Lynton Hora was no
longer worthy of consideration. There was no tie of
blood between them. Hora had deliberately deceived
him, poisoned his mind, robbed him of parents and
honour and love to gratify the malice in his heart. Guy
could not think of sparing him. There could be no
treachery where so deeply dyed a traitor was concerned.</p>

<p>"You'll say it's a deal?" asked Flurscheim again.</p>

<p>Captain Marven intervened. "Perhaps it will be best
to explain the whole of the circumstances to Mr. Flurscheim,"
he said quietly. "I know that he will treat the
family matters involved as purely confidential."</p>

<p>Flurscheim listened while Captain Marven deliberately
laid before him the facts. "You see," he added quietly,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
when he had finished the story, "that this matter cannot
remain a secret between us. This letter must be laid
before my chief."</p>

<p>"But that is madness," cried Flurscheim. He gesticulated
wildly in his excitement. He protested, he implored,
he argued that only an entirely wrong-headed
sense of duty could demand such a course of action.
But Marven remained inflexible, and Guy supported him
in his determination.</p>

<p>He was still arguing when the striking of a clock
warned Marven that he must leave. Already it had been
arranged that Guy was to accompany him to the Foreign
Office. "I shall come, too," declared the Jew. "Sir
Everard Markham is an old acquaintance of mine. Perhaps
he will make you listen to reason."</p>

<p>Neither Captain Marven nor Guy believed that he
would fulfil his threat. But they did not know the pertinacity
with which Flurscheim carried out every scheme
to which he had once set his hand. They left him on the
pavement, and drove to Whitehall, but Flurscheim followed
them a few minutes later. When he arrived at
the Foreign Office Captain Marven had already been
shown to the Permanent Secretary's room. Flurscheim
demanded notepaper, and, scribbling a hasty note, succeeded
in persuading a messenger to deliver it to Sir
Everard Markham at once. Then he sat down, and
awaited the result.</p>

<p>The note was delivered as he desired, but it remained
unopened for a while. The Permanent Secretary was
far too deeply immersed in the business in hand to have
a single thought for anything else.</p>

<p>It was a distasteful task which Sir Everard Markham
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
had undertaken to perform. Never before, during
his tenure of office, had he been called upon to question
the honesty of any of his trusted officials. That a soldier
and a gentleman could be so lost to all sense of honour
as to deliberately steal government secrets for purposes
of private gain was almost unthinkable. Yet the report
which Detective Inspector Kenly had made left very little
room for doubt as to Captain Marven's guilt. And Marven
was the last man whom he should have suspected of
such infamy. The Secretary of State, too, was as much
amazed as the Permanent Secretary at Kenly's report.
He also knew Captain Marven personally. He had dined
at his house, they belonged to the same clubs, he would
have pledged his whole estate on Marven's fidelity, and
yetâ€”he trusted that the damning facts might be explained
away, though he doubted that it would be possible
to furnish any plausible explanation of the facts
save one.</p>

<p>Most damning of all to both their minds was the final
item of information which Inspector Kenly had brought
with him shortly before the hour at which it had been arranged
for the King's Messenger to call. There could
only be one explanation of Lynton Hora's communication
with Marven within an hour or two of his reaching
town. The two men must be in close communication
with one another. Kenly himself no longer had any
doubts as to Captain Marven's guilt. He only regretted
that the exigencies of the situation were such that any
one of the gang would escape his clutches. Still, there
would be some satisfaction in having assisted to unmask
such a scoundrel. He looked forward to the interview
with keen anticipation. He had advised the course to be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
adopted, and, with some alterations of their own, both
the Great Man and the Permanent Secretary had fallen
in with his views.</p>

<p>But the interview was not destined to take the lines
suggested, for almost the first words Captain Marven
had spoken, when he had been ushered into the presence
of his three judges, had thrown the carefully discussed
plans into confusion. So intent was he on performing
the duty he had laid down for himself, that he observed
nothing out of the way in the presence of Sir Gadsby
Dimbleby and another man, a stranger to him, in the
Permanent Secretary's room. He did not observe that
neither the Permanent Secretary nor the Great Man had
offered him a hand, nor that there was a false ring about
the "How d'ye do, Marven," with which Sir Gadsby
greeted him. Trivialities, such as these, were of no importance
to the man who had before him the terrible duty
of denouncing the son whom he had but just found.</p>

<p>Captain Marven had mapped out for himself the course
to be pursued. First he must make amends for his own
share in the disclosure. He had failed in his trust.
He had allowed himself to fall into the trap laid for him.
There was only one way in which he could make amends.</p>

<p>"I suppose, Sir Markham," he said, "you have sent
for me in the ordinary course. I regret that some matters
I have to lay before you will probably lead you to
the conclusion that I am no longer fit to be entrusted
with your commands. I think it well to tell you at once,
in case you are in urgent need of a messenger, so that
you may communicate with the next man on the rota."</p>

<p>A dead silence followed his words. The Great Man
looked at the Permanent Secretary and the Permanent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
Secretary returned the glance. One thought was common
to each of their minds. Was Marven going to confess?
They suddenly became aware that the Captain
had aged considerably since they last saw him, that his
face was worn and lined, his eyes dull. Yet he held
himself erect, and his voice was calm.</p>

<p>He continued, "The matter is of importance. Of
course I can have no objection to the presence of Sir
Gadsby, but I do not recognise this gentleman,"â€”he indicated
Kenly with a gestureâ€”"and if he would retireâ€”â€”"</p>

<p>Kenly made no movement, and the Permanent Secretary
raised his eyebrows in mute enquiry to the Great
Man. Sir Gadsby coughed. Then he remarked drily,
"This gentleman is Detective Inspector Kenly of Scotland
Yard. It is my desire that he should hear why you
consider yourself unfit to be trusted with your duties as
a King's Messenger."</p>

<p>Captain Marven could not fail to understand the suggestion
which lay behind the Great Man's words. Still
more significant was the cold tone in which the words
were spoken. He was himself suspect. His summons
was not in the ordinary course of events. He was to
have been called to account. Well, what did it matter?
Yet, though his cheek flushed, and as suddenly paled, he
gave no other sign of agitation. "He has a soldier's
pluck, anyway," muttered Kenly to himself, as Marven
replied calmly, "Certainly, if you wish it, Sir Gadsby."</p>

<p>Marven turned immediately to the Permanent Secretary.
"I received barely two hours ago a letter from an
old brother officer of mine, named Hartley Ruthven, who
is now known by the name of Lynton Hora. I want you
to read that letter first. Afterwards I should like to add
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
any information which is in my possession to the disclosures
it contains."</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary took the letter from Marven's
hand, and glanced rapidly over the first page.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he said. He looked up and insensibly
his tone became more kindly. "Won't you sit down,
Marven?"</p>

<p>Captain Marven seated himself. The Permanent Secretary
read another page. Then he spoke again.</p>

<p>"Shall I read this letter to Sir Gadsby? I am sure
that if I say it is desirable that Mr. Kenly shall withdraw
he will not insist upon his remaining."</p>

<p>"I should prefer Mr. Kenly should hear the contents,"
answered Marven steadily.</p>

<p>The Permanent Secretary read the letter aloud. When
he concluded there was a silence that could be felt.</p>

<p>Marven broke it. "My son is waiting below to give
himself up to justice." His voice quivered for a moment,
then became steady again. "He is readyâ€”even
anxiousâ€”to pay the penalty."</p>

<p>Sir Gadsby's face became purple. He turned to Kenly.
"Here you, what the devil do you mean by letting this
dâ€”â€”d scoundrel Hora go about kidnapping honest men's
sons and bringing 'em up to break their father's hearts?
What is the use of a detective force at all?"</p>

<p>Kenly nearly fell off his chair at the suddenness of the
attack. He was far too amazed to defend himself. He
understood the next moment that the explosion was only
the ebullition of a warm heart which needed an outlet,
for the next moment the Great Man had taken Captain
Marven's hand and was shaking it violently, while he
stuttered out, "By Gad, Marven, I have to apologise to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
you. I've been thinking that you peeped into that despatch
box yourself. I'll never forgive myself for doubting
you."</p>

<p>Captain Marven smiled sadly. "Though unintentionally,
I have betrayed my trust," he said. "If I had been
more careful, my sonâ€”â€”" He could get no further.
The Great Man wiped his eyes and blew his nose violently.
He knew Marven's story, knew of his sorrow
and his hopes, and he could appreciate the wonderful
devotion to duty which had led him to so sacrifice his
son. He turned to the Permanent Secretary. "Look
here, Markham, we must put our old heads together and
get the boy out of this scrape somehow." He nodded
to the detective. "You ought to be able to suggest
something, Kenly."</p>

<p>The Inspector's face was a study. He foresaw all
his efforts being wasted. He set his lips doggedly.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you are asking me to assent in compounding
a felony," he answered sourly.</p>

<p>"Compounding a felony be dâ€”â€”d!" roared the Great
Man. "I'll guarantee it wouldn't be the first time you've
compounded."</p>

<p>To this totally undeserved slur, the Inspector was
about to make a heated reply, when the Permanent Secretary
intervened. "Sir Gadsby often says more than
he means," he remarked, adding thoughtfully, "â€”in
private life, of course."</p>

<p>The Great Man laughed, and said, "Yes, you must
not take my last remark to you literally, Inspector."</p>

<p>Kenly's face cleared, but he was still loth to let the
victim, about whom he had wound his net, escape.</p>

<p>"Do you propose to let this man Lynton Hora go free,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
then?" he asked. "What would Mr. Flurscheim say to
that?"</p>

<p>A totally unexpected answer came to the enquiry. The
Permanent Secretary had remembered the unopened
note which had been brought to him. He had torn it
open, and the signature had attracted his attention.</p>

<p>"Suppose we ask Mr. Flurscheim," he said. "Listen
to this," he read the note aloud.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"DEAR SIR MARKHAM: A friend of mine, from some
pig-headed notion of duty, is insisting on sending his
son to prison. I want you, before you take any action in
the matter, to hear what I have to say on the question.</p>

<p class="right">
<span style="margin-right: 9em;">"Very sincerely yours,</span><br>

course, understand that I am writing about Captain
Marven.</p>

<p>"PP. S.â€”I shall wait here until I see you."</p>
</div>

<p>The Great Man rubbed his hands together and
chuckled.</p>

<p>"Let us have Mr. Flurscheim up," he said.

<small>THE FRUITS OF A CRIMINAL PHILOSOPHY</small>
</h2></div>

<p>Lynton Hora was not to be allowed to escape. That
was the decision arrived at, after the prolonged conference
at the Foreign Office, and Detective Inspector
Kenly's mind was thereby disburdened of the fear lest
all his efforts should have been wasted. He would have
liked to have made certain of one prisoner there and
then, but this was forbidden him. He had no belief in
repentant offenders, and to him Guy appeared nothing
more. Still Flurscheim refused to charge Guy. Captain
Marven undertook to be responsible for his answering
any charge, Sir Everard Markham added his persuasions,
and Sir Gadsby Dimbleby declared that he
would take it as a personal insult if Guy were arrested
before the Master Criminal was laid by the heels. The
Great Man was far too great a man for a detective inspector
to offend, and so Guy left the Foreign Office with
Captain Marven to await the summons to surrender himself,
when information of Hora's arrest should reach
him.</p>

<p>The Captain was very grateful for the respite, none
the less because he had not personally urged it. For a
little while his son would be with him. As yet the
prison stain was not upon him. He was pathetically
anxious to become acquainted with the grown child
who was so soon to be torn away again. Duty may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
be sometimes an over-hard task-master, yet he faced it
manfully, and could at least find some small consolation
in the fact that his son faced it as manfully as himself.</p>

<p>Detective Inspector Kenly saw them drive away together,
and, as he caught sight of the look of pleasure
on the face of the King's Messenger, he was not altogether
sorry that he had been compelled to forego the
arrest.</p>

<p>"It's a curious tangle," he muttered. Then he hailed
a cab, and gave the address of a police court. Ten minutes'
interview with the magistrate was all he sought,
and, when he re-entered the waiting cab, he had in
his possession two documentsâ€”a warrant for Lynton
Hora's arrest, and a search warrant for the flat in Westminster
Mansions.</p>

<p>Thus provided for all emergencies, he drove straight
away for Hora's residence. There was no time to be
wasted. From what he had learned during the afternoon
it was clear that Lynton Hora must be aware that
at any moment his deeds might be brought to light, for
Guy had been called in to the conference, and he had
revealed all that had passed between himself and the
man he had believed to be his father.</p>

<p>On arrival at Westminster Mansions Inspector Kenly
stamped his foot with vexation on learning that Lynton
Hora had gone out. His subordinate was absent, too.
If flight was in Hora's mind, the sergeant would obey
the instructions and detain him. Kenly determined to
make use of the absence to execute the search warrant
in his possession. But he was not going to leave anything
to chance. He telephoned to Scotland Yard for
further assistance, and, pending its arrival, he chatted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
with his old friend, the hall porter, and from him he
learned that the other occupant of the flat had also gone
out that morning, and had not returned. This seemed
more like preparation for flight than ever, but Myra's absence
also left him a clear field for his investigations. A
very few minutes elapsed before the assistance he had
asked for arrived. He left one of the two plain-clothes
men in the hall and took the other with him upstairs.
No one was aware of the nature of their business, and
the two men entered the flat with the service key.
Kenly did not waste time on a careful examination of
the lower rooms. He went directly to the floor leading
to the attics where Hora's "collection" was stored.
He only wanted to verify the information which Guy
had given as to the whereabouts of the Greuze. He had
long since provided himself with a key to the lock of the
door so that admission to the attics presented no difficulty.
Guy had spoken truly. Kenly found the Greuze
and the snuff-boxes stolen from Flurscheim's house. He
saw also that there was a rich store of other articles in
locked cabinets and cases, for which no doubt he would
be able to find owners. But he did not linger to examine
them. There would be plenty of time for that after
Hora had been apprehended.</p>

<p>After he had been apprehended! Kenly did not
allow himself to consider the possibility that he might
escape. Yet as minutes passed by and the minutes
added themselves into hours, he began to be uneasy in
his mind. His uneasiness became acute apprehension
when, as dusk was falling, the subordinate to whom had
been entrusted the duty of shadowing Hora returned
to the Mansions alone.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>

<p>A rich variety of objurgations rose to the Inspector's
tongue, but there was no time to be lost in uttering them.
He enquired where Hora had been lost sight of. The
man explained to the best of his ability. He had followed
Hora to Waterloo railway station, had heard him
take a return ticket to Worcester Park, had himself
booked to the same destination, had taken a seat in the
next compartment, had watched to see whether he
alighted at any intermediate station, and on arrival at
Worcester Park had discovered that the compartment
in which Hora had travelled was empty.</p>

<p>Kenly reflected. Worcester Park was two stations
further down the line than Wimbledon. What if Hora
had wished to see Jessel again? He turned to the man.
"Was Hora carrying a small black bag and an overcoat
on his arm?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"You idiot," muttered Kenly; then he added, "You
will wait here until Hora returns, or you are relieved.
If he comes back, you will arrest him and take him
straight to Bow Street. If the girl returns, arrest her,
too." Then he turned to the other two men. "Go
back to the Yard, and have a full description of him and
the girl telegraphed to every port in the kingdom. Stay,
though, you had better wire, also, particulars of the disguise
in which he succeeded in eluding this dolt."</p>

<p>The subordinate shivered, and realised that if Hora
did not return it would be advisable for him to retire
from the force.</p>

<p>Kenly dictated a description of Hora's clerical disguise.
There was yet a chance that he might get upon
his track. He jumped into the first cab that passed and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
drove away to Waterloo. He could have wept with
vexation at the thought of his prey escaping so easily,
through the incompetence of his subordinate. He
looked at his watch. A train was timed to start for
Wimbledon in two minutes. With luck he would just
catch it. He lifted the trap in the roof of the hansom, and
shouted, "Hurry up, cabby, I have a train to catch."</p>

<p>Luck was apparently against him. Traffic was heavy
and the cab was caught in a block. Kenly writhed with
impatience. But a moment later the traffic block appeared
to be a special dispensation of Providence.
Kenly caught sight, in the light of a street lamp, of an
old clergyman, in shabby hat and cloak and carrying a
small black bag, amongst the crowd on the sidewalk.
He could have shouted aloud with delight. He jumped
out of the cab, and tossed the driver a half-crown piece.
His first impulse was to dash forward, and there and
then effect the arrest. He had recognised Hora, he
could have sworn to the distinguishing limp. But a
second thought restrained him. Though Guy's statements
had been apparently full and frank, Kenly had not
credited him when he had declared that he and Lynton
Hora worked alone. He had thought that there must
be other members of the gang, a supposition which had
been fed by the information he had extracted from Jessel.
Hora had worn his clerical disguise when communicating
with Jessel. What more likely than that he
should put it on when communicating with other tools?
Kenly determined to follow him.</p>

<p>Soon he was glad that he had done so. Hora apparently
had no intention of returning to Westminster Mansions.
He boarded an omnibus which took him northwards.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
Kenly sat behind him while they drove through
the brilliant streets of the West End. He changed the
bus for another travelling westwards, the detective at
his heels. Passengers came and went, but Hora remained
until the end of the journey.</p>

<p>Kenly knew the district, and he thought that his suppositions
were about to be verified when he observed the
direction Hora took upon alighting. That way led to
the quarter where the thieves of the metropolis had
gathered and made themselves a colony when their old
haunts in the centre of the city had been mowed down.
He felt in his pocket for his whistle, and wished that he
had slipped a revolver into his pocket that morning.
But he followed, nevertheless, and was thankful when a
couple of uniformed policemen came in sight. As he
passed them he uttered a single word. The constables
apparently took no notice, but when Kenly was half the
length of the street distant they wheeled round and followed
him steadily.</p>

<p>Hora pursued his way in a manner that showed that
the quarter was not strange to him. The detective
hunched his shoulders, pulled his cap down over his
ears, and turned up his coat collar. Here he might be
recognised any moment. He did not want to alarm his
quarry.</p>

<p>Hora turned into Fancy Lane. He was walking more
quickly now. He disappeared under the archway which
led to "Ma" Norton's disreputable shed. Arriving
there Kenly paused. The two policemen turned into
the lane. He held up his hand and plunged into the
blackness. The constables came on, and arriving at
the entrance they stood there chatting quietly. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
their eyes were keenly observant, and each had loosened
the truncheon hidden beneath his tunic. They were in
the enemy's country, and at any moment might be called
upon to fight for their lives.</p>

<p>Kenly blundered on through the darkness, guided by
the sound of voices, until he emerged into the yard.
There his attention was attracted by a dull light filtering
through dirty panes of glass. It seemed to him evidence
that his objective was attained. Stealthily he made his
way to the window and peeped through.</p>

<p>He had seen many strange tableaux during his career,
but none stranger than that he now looked upon. He saw
a dropsical old woman, with a glass in her hand and a
maudlin grin on her bloated face, balancing herself with
difficulty on a rickety chair. He saw Lynton Hora, with
a mocking smile on his face, by no means in keeping
with his clerical garb, pointing to the hideous figure.
He saw another man at Hora's elbow, a bullet-headed
man, with closely cropped red hair and with flushed
face, whose eyes never wandered from the face of the
fourth member of the party. Kenly recognised her, too.
Myra's beauty was not easily forgotten, and it peeped
out from beneath the mask of horror which was drawn
over her face.</p>

<p>Hora was speaking.</p>

<p>"So you have found your way back to your native
slum, Myra. Do you find it congenial to your dainty
spirit? I see your mother is celebrating your return.
One day you will be like her." He wheeled round rapidly
and glanced at the man at his elbow. "You have
found an admirer, too, as well as a mother. You have
lost no time."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span></p>

<p>Myra threw out her hands imploringly.</p>

<p>"Take me away, Commandatore. Take me away," she
cried. She saw that Hora hesitated, and she renewed her
appeal.</p>

<p>"Why should I take you away?" he answered. "I
offered you a husband and a home. You let them escape
you." He jerked his head to the man. "Hagan
here will supply you with both. Why should I interfere?"</p>

<p>The hope died out of her face and the fear reappeared
as the man lurched forward.</p>

<p>"'Ear what the Master says; e's a toff at spoutin', is
the Master," he said, with an ugly leer on his face.</p>

<p>She shrank from his touch, and looked vainly round
for a way of escape. Kenly thought of a hare he had
once seen as it doubled almost at his feet from two
pursuing greyhounds. He placed his whistle between
his lips ready.</p>

<p>"Stand back, Hagan," said Hora authoritatively.</p>

<p>The man dropped his hand, but there was a frown
on his face.</p>

<p>"Suppose I were to take you away?" he asked.</p>

<p>Hope shone out in her face again.</p>

<p>"Ask of me anything you will," she cried. "Anything
but this."</p>

<p>She had forgotten everything in the supreme horror
of the hideous hole in which she had found herself.</p>

<p>That morning when she had left Lynton Hora's abode
she had thought she had been incapable of further suffering.
She had gone out into the park and sat there
hour after hour, conscious at first only of the one fact
that Guy was lost to her forever. She had told herself
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
that she would never return to Lynton Hora's roof to
face his sneers. He had always hated her. She had no
doubt that he was aware all the time that Guy would
never marry her, and that he had only bidden her try
to win his love that she might be humiliated by its rejection.
Perhaps he had lied to her about her mother
and her home, merely that she might not be tempted to
escape from him. The sound of the word mother appealed
strongly to her in her dazed condition. Her
mother could not be worse than Hora. She had the address.
One day she had copied it down carefully. The
slip of paper was still in her purse.</p>

<p>She had found her way thither with difficulty. Not
until she had lost herself amongst the streets in the
neighbourhood of Fancy Lane did she begin to regain
her senses. Then the words of coarse abuse from the
doors of public houses, the shrill voices of women from
open doors, made her wish for flight. Darkness had
fallen on the face of the town by that time, and she
became aware that she was nearly exhausted. Then a
child had led her to Fancy Lane, and another youngster,
for the gift of a sixpence, had acted as guide to her
destination. Everybody in Fancy Lane knew "Ma"
Norton.</p>

<p>The bully on his way to his favourite drinking shop
had seen her passing along the street. A flash of the
stones set in the bracelet she still wore on her wristâ€”the
bracelet Guy had given herâ€”attracted his attention.
He had changed his purpose and followed her.</p>

<p>Myra had known that Hora had spoken only too truly
the moment she entered the den, where Mrs. Norton was
soaking herself to death in alcohol. The old woman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
had been just too tipsy to comprehend who her visitor
was. Myra had soon given up the task of trying to explain.
She had found a lamp, and, after lighting it, had
shuddered with disgust at the filthy surroundings revealed
by the light. She could not stop there. She had
risen to leave, but found the exit blocked by the burly
figure of Bully Hagan.</p>

<p>He had heard her attempts to make Mrs. Norton understand
who she was. This was "Ma's" lady daughter.
He foresaw profit in the fact. When his eyes
rested on Myra's perfect figure silhouetted against the
lamp she had lighted, another thought entered into his
brain. He did not at first disclose his thought. Myra
thought he was merely intent upon plunder. When she
understood, she realised how the Sabine women must
have felt; she experienced the emotions of the women
of a Balkan village when an Albanian regiment was let
loose upon it.</p>

<p>For an hour Myra had kept him at bay, her faculties
racked to the utmost. Then Lynton Hora had come on
the scene, and she had appealed to him.</p>

<p>Now Hora seemed to be considering her appeal, and
her face brightened with hope as she gazed eagerly on
his face. He responded with a smile.</p>

<p>"It is lucky for you that I thought of coming and
looking for you here," he said. "Whatever you have
done or left undone would not deserve such a fate as
that."</p>

<p>He indicated the man at his elbow with a gesture of
scorn.</p>

<p>"You will take me home again." The relief was so
great that she could scarcely believe it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, come along. It is getting late."</p>

<p>An angry growl arrested him.</p>

<p>"No, you don't," said Hagan.</p>

<p>The veins of the bully's forehead were swollen and his
fists clenched.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way," said Hora, in the tone he would
have used to a cur in the street, and, as the man did not
stir, he caught him by the arm and thrust him aside so
violently that he crashed against the opposite wall.</p>

<p>"Come, Myra," said Hora.</p>

<p>Kenly lost nothing of the scene. He saw the look on
the bully's face as he picked himself up. He saw a
flash of steel in his hand. The whistle he held between
his teeth shrilled out as he left the window and dashed
to the door. The sound was answered by other whistles,
and he heard the rush of feet towards him down
the passage. He reached the door, but it stuck fast.
The sound of the advancing feet was drowned by a
woman's shriek. Kenly hurled his whole weight against
the door. The shriek was repeated. A second time the
detective hurled himself against the door. This time
the catch gave way and he blundered forward into the
room.</p>

<p>Two figures lay prone upon the floor, a man stood
over them calmly wiping the blood-stained blade of a
knife on his sleeve. A dropsical old woman sat gazing
with a maudlin smile on her face at the scene.</p>

<p>Kenly's head whirled. He stood still, mechanically,
until panting breath behind him gave warning that assistance
had arrived.</p>

<p>Hagan coolly handed him the knife.</p>

<p>"I done it," he said; "I've outed 'em both."
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>

<p>Then he held out his hands for the bracelets.</p>

<p>Kenly stooped to the floor, and laid his finger on
Myra's wrist. The pulse had ceased to beat. He laid
her hand down again, and bent over Lynton Hora. The
Master lay perfectly still, and even while the detective
bent over him a glaze spread itself over the open eyes.
Kenly's quarry had escaped him.

<p>Captain Marven never had cause to mourn for a
son hidden behind the bars of a convict prison.</p>

<p>The fate which had fallen upon Lynton Hora was so
full of horror that even Detective Inspector Kenly
would have been willing to admit that a greater power
than that of the law he had striven to enforce had administered
justice. When his chief, therefore, told him
that he was expected to keep a discreet silence in regard
to the part Guy had played in the Flurscheim robbery,
he could hardly squeeze out a sigh. Later, he was to
win his reward when, by means of the Great Man's recommendation,
he was appointed to the chief constableship
of an important borough where his position was
such that Mrs. Detective Inspector was compelled finally
and for all time to renounce taking in lodgers.</p>

<p>Mr. Hildebrand Flurscheim once again rejoiced in
the possession of his Greuze. It returned to its old place
on his wall, so that morning and night he could feast
his eyes upon its beauties. Jessel never applied for the
reward. He returned to the shadows from which he
had emerged. In fact, he felt that he could not be
happy in a land where he was so well known to an important
member of the detective force of the police. But
Flurscheim always lamented that, since the Greuze and
other valuables had been returned to him, it would be
impossible for him to liquidate his debt to Guy, who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
insisted even upon returning the miniature which bore so
great a likeness to Meriel.</p>

<p>That miniature, however, came again into Guy's possession
in the form of a wedding gift, when Meriel
Challys changed her name to Meriel Marven. The
Jew's words had borne fruit. She found a loving duty
in helping Guy to bury his past, and Captain and Mrs.
Marven found a renewal of their own youth in the happiness
which attended the union. As for Guyâ€”well, he
has been heard to declare that the waters of his life are
full of star-dust.</p>

<p>Nor is "Hill Rise" one of those dreary, unpleasant creations
known as a "problem novel." It has a strong, virile, intensely
exciting plot, full of vigorous action, sustained suspense,
thrilling episode and continuous surprises. The character drawing
is almost miraculous in its fidelity to human nature. The
whole story is powerful, simple and intense. The sort of a

<p>"The Man in the Basement" is perhaps the strangest story ever
written. Its every situation is out of the common and startlingly
unique. It compares to the average detective or mystery romance as
Sherlock Holmes compares with "Deadwood Dick" or some other dime novel
hero. The characters, most of them are Danes, and the wild, breezy
freedom and charm of the North are strikingly portrayed. </p></div>

<p>"F. Frankfort Moore, author of 'The Jessamy Bride' and many other
pleasing stories, has taken John Wesley as the leading character in his
latest romance, 'The Love That Prevailed.' The evangelist is portrayed
in connection with a group of Cornish villagers. He actually loses his
heart to the Dolly Varden of the neighborhood, but, his unswerving
sense of honor controlling him, the more exalted love of Truth to
which he has dedicated his life is the love that prevails. But the
sensational matter in the story is the commotion caused by a distraught
disciple of the revivalist foretelling the immediate end of the world.
Upon the day he has set for the cataclysm the elements seem to aid
and abet him. His manner of self-destruction at the stormy crisis is
adequately awful. The minor characters are drawn well, particularly
the fox-hunting parson who tells Wesley he has done great mischief
with his Methodism; that before he came the parishioners were very
comfortableâ€”'Sir, there was not a man of my flock who knew that he had
a soul. There was a healthy condition of things for you!'"â€”<i>N. Y.
